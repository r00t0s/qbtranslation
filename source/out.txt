CINE_31_100_000B_BETH=[24-25.85] And here I thought this was going to be a rescue.[28.4-30.1] Bet there's a story here...[32.9-34.2] Serene's right-hand man.[37.4-38.5] I hope you said no.[45.8-46.6] I just gave you one.
CINE_31_100_000B_JACK=[22.6-23.5] Thanks for showing up.[30.1-31.2] You know a guy called Hatch?[34.15-37.6] He was here. He gave me this big speech about how he wants to take down Paul.[40.15-43.45] I didn't trust him for a second. He set me loose anyways, told me to wait for an opening.[51.65-52.3] Appreciate it.
CINE_31_300_000_TIME_TROOPER_#1=[14.3-16.1] Hang on, it's... okay, I got it.
CINE_31_300_000_TIME_TROOPER_#2=[16.3-16.8] How's that?
CINE_32_200_000_BETH=[35.6-38.9] What the--[46.3-50.4] Jesus, look at all this.[79.8-81.7] Yeah, well, Monarch does.[86.5-88.7] I don’t think my cover’s gonna last.
CINE_32_250_000_BETH=[15-19.2] Jack, get her moving before time kicks back in and that drone turns us into paste.[48.7-49.7] It’s collapsing![67.9-68.8] It's right there.[73-74.2] C’mon, Doctor.
CINE_32_250_000_MONARCH_GUARD=[77.5-81.1] Spread out! It's Joyce, somehow he got right past us!
CINE_32_250_000_MONARCH_GUARD_#2=[81.9-85.1] Don't let them escape! Somebody call Mr. Serene!
CINE_32_400_000_JACK=[51.7-52.3] Uhh!
CINE_32_400_000_JACK_INTERVIEW=[2.15-5.1] Of course... some cars need stealing more than others.
CINE_32_400_000_KATE=[0-2] You stole Paul's car?
CINE_33_040_000_JACK=[19.55-22.5] Beth. I think I'm gonna need a ride. The streets are too hot.
CINE_33_040_000_JACK_INTERVIEW=[6.7-16.4] Yeah. They made that clear. Monarch lined every escape route with barricades, roadblocks. I had to get to the mainland, but I couldn't do it by car. I needed a new plan.
CINE_33_040_000_KATE=[0.1-6.5] You took the one thing Paul needed to survive. Doctor Amaral. That made you priority one.   
CINE_33_060_000_1A_ADULT_SON=[0-0] Hey, what’s the hold up?
CINE_33_060_000_1A_BETH=[5.5-8.3] Alright, any bright ideas?
CINE_33_060_000_1A_BRIDGE_PROTESTER=[0-0] Don't think we're gonna forget what you did to Amy! Our eyes are open! Every atrocity you commit is just fueling our fire! There's no way in hell you're going to get away with this! 
CINE_33_060_000_1A_JACK=[0.15-5.2] It's getting tense out there. If I go anywhere near that thing there’s gonna be innocent people caught in the crossfire.
CINE_33_060_000_1A_MONARCH_GUARD_2=[0-0] I don't care how bad it looks. If we let Joyce or Wilder across that bridge we're pink slips. Or worse.[34.6-38] Calm down. I need to take a look at your truck.
CINE_33_060_000_1A_MONARCH_GUARD_6=[0-0] You realize every minute we spend out here is more ammunition for a media shit-storm.[10.5-12.1] Don't even wanna think about it.
CINE_33_060_000_1B_BETH=[5.5-8.3] Alright, any bright ideas?
CINE_33_060_000_1B_JACK=[0.15-5.2] It's getting tense out there. If I go anywhere near that thing there’s gonna be innocent people caught in the crossfire.
CINE_33_060_000_1B_MONARCH_GUARD_2=[0-0] Thanks for your patience, folks, we'll have you on your way again soon.
CINE_33_060_000_BETH=[19.8-22.95] Can't stay here long, Jack. You're gonna need to be quick.[25.3-26.1] Bad news?
CINE_33_060_000_JACK=[22.9-24.3] Yeah, about that.[26.5-27.8] Reoccurring theme of the night.[29.4-30.9] I'm looking at the bridge right now.
CINE_33_060_000_MONARCH_GUARD_7=[4-8.5] Still have no visual on Joyce and Wilder, doing another sweep.
CINE_33_061_000_BETH=[11.6-14.3] Nice and bright for Monarch to see.[19.3-22.5] I’ll be there in a few minutes. Don’t stand me up.
CINE_33_061_000_JACK=[0-0] Yeah.[0.9-7.15] Let me see... there’s a pier under the bridge. You should be able to meet me there with the boat.[9.5-11.5] Giant gas sign out front. Can’t miss it.[14.9-19] There's not a lot of options. Switching to Monarch frequencies. I'll be in touch soon.
CINE_33_070_000_1A_COLLEGE_PROTESTER=[6.1-14.1] Hey! You down there! Don't come up here, man! Monarch’s got this whole place locked down!
CINE_33_090_000_1A_COLLEGE_GIRL=[9.9-11.1] What'd you do!
CINE_33_090_000_1A_MONARCH_RADIO_COMMANDER=[10.8-13.7] I said maintain control!
CINE_33_122_000_JACK=[0-0] <grunts as he falls>
CINE_33_122_000_JACK_INTERVIEW=[20.4-29.8] The Fracture was escalating. Objects were moving out of time, out of order, entire timelines overlapping. And it was gonna get worse... unless we could stop it. 
CINE_41_100_000_1A_3A_BETH=[11.42-16] You say you're "prepared," but no part of this plan of yours involves stopping it from happening. [43.2-53.6] Your research is based on work by William Joyce. You respected him. He knew that the Fracture would occur, but he also knew that it could be fixed.[57.75-72.3] Will built a way to stop the Fracture. This. The countermeasure. We're traveling to the past to retrieve it. You can help us get there faster... [74.2-77.9] Or... you can agree to disagree.
CINE_41_100_000_1A_3A_JACK=[22.9-25.3] Hey! This isn't a debate![25.7-33.4] I just watched a ship fast forward through a fucking bridge! Time is running out, and the Fracture is getting worse by the minute.[88-93.5] Nick, bring Sofia to the machine. Keep an eye on her.
CINE_41_100_000_1A_3A_NICK=[93-94] You got it.[101.5-104.7] Welcome to the team Doc. Don't make me shoot you.
CINE_41_100_000_1A_3A_SOFIA=[4.2-11.8] You don't understand the power you're wielding! You need to hand this technology over to Monarch. I've prepared for what happens next.[16.8-20.6] Even if I fix William's machine, what could you possibly hope to achieve? [20.7-22.7] The End of Time is coming. There's no way to--[33.1-42.2] And it cannot be stopped! Paul has been to the End of Time, he's witnessed it first hand! Can't you see? We prepared for what's next out of necessity.[82.7-87.2] I'll have to run diagnostics on the machine. I can't promise anything before that.
CINE_41_100_000_1B_3A_AMY=[91-92] Sure thing.[94.5-105.7] Okay, Doctor, let's go. And I can see right through you. Don't try anything stupid. You will regret it.
CINE_41_100_000_1B_3A_BETH=[11.3-16] You say you're "prepared," but no part of this plan of yours involves stopping it from happening. [43.1-53.6] Your research is based on work by William Joyce. You respected him. He knew that the Fracture would occur, but he also knew that it could be fixed.[57.9-72.35] Will built a way to stop the Fracture. This. The countermeasure. We're traveling to the past to retrieve it. You can help us get there faster... [74.3-77.9] Or... you can agree to disagree.
CINE_41_100_000_1B_3A_JACK=[22.9-25.3] Hey! This isn't a debate![25.7-33.35] I just watched a ship fast forward through a fucking bridge! Time is running out, and the Fracture is getting worse by the minute.[87.4-91.4] Amy, take Amaral to the machine. Keep an eye on her.
CINE_41_100_000_1B_3A_SOFIA=[4.2-11.5] You don't understand the power you're wielding! You need to hand this technology over to Monarch. I've prepared for what happens next.[16.8-20.6] Even if I fix William's machine, what could you possibly hope to achieve? [20.7-22.7] The End of Time is coming. There's no way to--[33.1-42.1] And it cannot be stopped! Paul has been to the End of Time, he's witnessed it first hand! Can't you see? We prepared for what's next out of necessity.[82.7-87.4] I'll have to run diagnostics on the machine. I can't promise anything before that.
CINE_41_200_000_JACK=[18-19] What's wrong?[29.4-30.3] You made this?[36.65-41] The woman in that picture. It's you, isn't it. So... who's the little girl?[80.7-81.7] It was you.[144.8-145.55] Beth...
CINE_52A_200_000_JACK=[92.1-94] You're the reason he built the countermeasure. 
CINE_52A_300_000_JACK=[26.2-28] I can't imagine what happened to you.[31.2-36.5] When you entered that machine, I wanted to go after you, but -- I didn't know where Sofia sent you, or how to find you--[45.4-48.3] Whatever happened to you, we'll change it.[49-50.2] We can fix this.[52.6-54] We can undo this, we--[70.4-72.25] I can't just sit back and do nothing.[131.3-132.5] Then we'll die finding out.
CINE_52B_100_000_BETH=[22.9-23.55] Yeah.[36.4-37.3] There it is.
CINE_52B_100_000_JACK=[22.1-22.9] You okay?
CINE_52B_100_000_JACK_INTERVIEW=[2-19.85] I don't know a fraction of the hell that Beth went through. What she experienced when she saw the End of Time, how that changed her, like it changed Paul. Followed by eleven years of living like a ghost. The Beth I'd known had laser focus. This Beth... she had doubts.[28.1-35.35] But the countermeasure, the one thing that could set things right, was waiting for us at Will's workshop. And this was our only chance to get it.
CINE_52B_200_300_BETH=[31.3-32.9] What if you're wrong?[184-185.8] You can't--
CINE_52B_200_300_KATE=[200.8-208] A rash decision. You claim Beth Wilder's death had no impact on your behavior, but--[214.6-219.2] So what you did next... it wasn't personal?
CINE_52B_200_300_KATE_ON-SCREEN=[86.75-99.1] Except one. The blast sent you through time. Brought you back to 2016, the same exact time from which you left. Something anchored you there. [106.15-108.2] We need to know how you did this.
CINE_52B_200_300_SERENE=[0.55-3.2] You're the only other one who's seen what I've seen.[4.7-6.6] You know what's coming.[8.9-11] Give me the device.[12.7-13.7] Come with me.[15.3-17.5] We can survive this together.[19-21] You know it can't be stopped.[22.85-24.6] I can see it in your eyes.[27.1-28.4] You know this.[182.5-184.1] I'm not wrong.
CINE_61_100_000_JACK_INTERVIEW=[11.3-16.45] Time was broken, working out of sync. The city was in a state of chaos.[23.9-25.15] The End of Time was closing in. [27.9-31.2] The solution was inside Monarch Tower. The countermeasure.[40.5-41.55] I had a better plan.
CINE_61_100_000_KATE=[25.4-27.2] And you still believed you could fix it.[31.8-40.35] The CFR, as Monarch knew it. The key to the Lifeboat Protocol, Monarch's survival plan. But that didn't seem to matter to you. 
CINE_61_100_000A_BOBBY_RADFORD=[0.7-14.3] ...and it's obvious the city's going crazy, the entire world -- I can't even keep up with the reports. Listeners, you really want to stay indoors, don't go outside, we don't know what this is, but it's just one horrible accident after another...
CINE_61_100_000B_THERESA_SEDMAK=[0.7-13] ...to reiterate, the entire town now seems to be a disaster area, and while authorities and relief workers from Monarch are redoubling their efforts, it seems everybody's working at capacity, and reports coming from all across the world are...
CINE_61_200_000_SERENE=[18.4-21.3] My office alarm went off. Is that you skulking around, Jack?[24.9-27.35] Yes, of course. The CFR.[27.8-33.8] If you understood just how much depended on that, you'd leave it alone. But I know you don't care.[38.5-43.6] Yes. Yes, everything will play out as it has to play out.[45.7-47.6] I'll see you very soon, Jack.
CINE_61_225_000_JACK=[18.2-20.4] Just one of you? Really?[22.8-25.2] Look, you have to realize you're not gonna keep me from the CFR.[28.3-29.8] You don't look like you're in any shape for this.
CINE_61_225_000_LIAM=[31.9-32.6] Emily.
CINE_62_100_000_JACK=[11.9-12.6] What's up, fellas.[30.1-31.2] C'mon!
CINE_62_100_000_MONARCH_GUARD_RAIDER_5=[8.3-9.8] Targets have escaped the lab![12.55-13.5] Oh, shit!
CINE_63_250_000A_SERENE=[2.8-3.9] Better not, Jack.[7.6-11.5] I don't know how Will managed to get here, but... forget him.[18.3-22] Yes, it is. Hence the Lifeboat program.[28.7-30.7] You stole the CFR, Jack.[32.4-33.75] And the plan depends on it.[35.1-39.1] So... I'll take that back now, please.[50.25-51.4] I know.
CINE_63_400_410_450_470_JACK=[14.4-15.8] Just hurry up![19.3-23] It's like I'm pushing against the -- entire goddamn universe![54.9-56.1] Will.[59.3-60.4] C'mon.[60.8-61.5] C'mon![63.9-65.8] I think we just saved the universe.[70.7-73.3] He's Dead. He's gone. I don't know, it doesn't matter.[74-76.2] Will, he was wrong about everything.[78.4-79.4] Will.[81.8-83.25] The countermeasure worked.[181.65-182.9] I'll come back for you.
CINE_63_400_410_450_470_JACK_INTERVIEW=[44.8-45.9] The countermeasure.[46.4-53.6] It stitched time back together, everywhere. The destruction couldn't be undone. The lives we lost were real. But we fixed it. [56.1-57.3] The clocks kept on ticking.
CINE_63_400_410_450_470_KATE=[142.9-144.4] One more question.[145.15-151.75] Paul Serene's entire philosophy was that time is a set path, and nothing can be changed.[153.9-156.1] At the time, you obviously disagreed.[157.3-165] But after everything you've seen and done, we need to know... what do you believe now?[171.7-173.1] Was he right?[177.6-180.2] Or is it possible to change things?
CINE_63_400_410_450_470_WILLIAM=[10.2-11.1] Don't stop![16.4-17.1] It's working![24.3-25.3] I've got it![53.4-54.1] Jack.[60.8-61.5] Ow.[66.3-68.5] Yeah. Where's Paul?[76.8-77.6] Was he?[88-91.8] Whoa. The countermeasure burned out.[93.8-94.8] Okay...[95.5-98.9] But the Meyer-Joyce field should be stable now...[113.4-122.5] Of course, I'll have to run a few tests to confirm. But there's... well, there's no reason to believe that the Fracture isn't over.[126.3-127.2] Whoa.
CINE_63_500_000_HATCH=[22.2-23.25] Mr. Joyce.[32.9-38.5] Well, you were at the heart of all of this. And you can understand our need to find out exactly what happened...[43.2-53] Paul Serene always danced to his own tune. You know that. He and his delusions did tremendous damage to Monarch. But we can still salvage this company.[53.9-55.2] We could use a man like you.[56-58.4] It's not the same Monarch you know, Mr. Joyce.[59.4-65.6] Your exceptional qualities are obvious. And we both know you have certain needs our expertise could help with.[66.8-68] We can help each other.
CINE_63_500_000_JACK=[6.9-9.3] Yeah... well, that patience is starting to wear pretty thin.[29.4-32.6] Finally. Thought you wanted to talk, not get my life story.[38.8-41.9] I hear it's all being pinned on Paul. That's quite the feat.
CINE_63_500_000_KATE_ON-SCREEN=[2.3-6.7] You've been very patient with us... and very helpful. Thank you.[10.5-11.6] Of course.[14.7-15.7] Right outside.
CINE_AMY_VIDEO_001_BELINDA_WU=[0-0] ...Amy Ferrero, an eyewitness on the scene. Amy, tell us, what is going on here?[0-0] Sounds like a terrifying scene down there. We really appreciate your bravery going on record to speak out against what appears to be such a dangerous person.
CINE_DIARY01_BETH=[0-0] October 9th, zero-four-hundred hours. Monarch operation moves into the university in fifteen minutes.[0-0] This is it. Years of training, all leading up to this moment. Just need to keep my cover just a little bit longer. Monarch's objective is to apprehend Jack and William Joyce, "alive if possible." If what she told me is true then this operation is gonna end in a shit storm. It's up to me to make sure Jack gets out of this thing in one piece, but I can't risk blowing my cover just yet. [0-0] The notebook didn't give any orders regarding William. Still not sure how Jack is the key to all of this if William is the one with all the answers. We're about to find out. [0-0] Okay. It's time to do this. Beth Wilder, signing off. 
CINE_DIARY02_JACK=[0-0] He knew he had to get on the inside if he was gonna put a stop to it. I've got a better question for you: why did Monarch secretly push to get my brother hired if they knew he was a threat? You wanted him there. Why?[0-0] Don't play games with me.[0-0] You forget that I know things I didn't back then. I know what really happened to Doctor Kim.[0-0] You want me to tell the truth? Then it goes both ways.
CINE_DIARY02_KATE=[0-0] Your brother was hired as head advisor on Project Promenade. Given William's concerns with the project, why do you think he accepted the position?[0-0] That is simply untrue. Monarch invested heavily in the university experiment. It made sense to offer our own chronon researcher, Doctor Kim, as the lead developer on the project. Kim's death was a tragedy for us all, but when he passed--[0-0] Excuse me?[0-0] What exactly are you inferring?
CINE_DIARY02A_SERENE=[0-0] I ordered the execution of the man who I once considered to be my closest friend.[0-0] I did what was necessary. In order to proceed I need to distance myself from my past, my weaknesses. There is a simple truth that I knew Jack would never understand. I've spent years trying to find a way to change the course we're on. It can't be altered. The end is coming, and only I can prepare us for it. If Jack ever learned the truth... I can't risk that. I've come too far. [0-0] There's somebody else opposing me. Somebody on the inside.[0-0] The sickness is spreading. Visions are becoming more frequent. I'm having increasing difficulty holding on to the present. They need me to be strong. The Lifeboat depends on it.[0-0] I hope to god Doctor Amaral finds a more permanent solution soon. The treatments won't last much longer. 
CINE_DIARY02B_SERENE=[0-0] I know what they'll say. I've turned my back on Monarch, on the mission, for him. For Jack. The contrary is true. Jack could be our greatest asset if I can just make him understand. He needs time to understand, to process what has happened. Eventually he'll see. He's the only one who possesses the same power, the lens to see clearly what I see every moment of every day. What's coming. The inevitability of it all.[0-0] I just received word that shots were fired as Hatch delivered his speech. Shots meant for me.[0-0] There's somebody else opposing me. Somebody on the inside.[0-0] The sickness is spreading. Visions are becoming more frequent. I'm having increasing difficulty holding on to the present. They need me to be strong. The Lifeboat depends on it.[0-0] I hope to god Doctor Amaral finds a more permanent solution soon. The treatments won't last much longer. 
CINE_DIARY03_WILLIAM=[0-0] It's April 2nd, 1999. It’s been about a month since the incident; since I got shot by the man from the future. Since Wilder. I’ve moved the machine, hidden it. I wish I could destroy it, but, uh...[0-0] I made her tell me as little as possible. The more you know about what’ll happen, the worse it'll be. We’re all puppets. I can take that for as long as I can't tell the difference. I think she understood...[0-0] Doesn’t matter anyway. She told me the Fracture is gonna happen. Because of what I did. It’s...[0-0] I have to fix it. I have to. I don’t know how, yet, I have to -- I have to build a countermeasure of some kind. I know the theoretical mechanism of the field’s collapse. How to stop, let alone reverse it... It’ll take years of research. I have no idea how to do this. How to pay for it. I don’t know.[0-0] Wilder is from the future, and she came to me. I have to assume that I was successful. Right?[0-0] Why else would she come to me?
CINE_DIARY03A_JACK=[0-0] You tried to kill him. I don't think he liked that. [0-0] He was the only one I got there in time to save. I saw that room. The bodies. None of the witnesses from the university got out alive. [0-0] No, you fucking killed them. All of them. You went too far. Seeing those bodies changed everything. I knew I had to stop it, stop it from ever happening in the first place.[0-0] Fuck you.
CINE_DIARY03B_JACK=[0-0] Monarch framed me. Made the entire city believe I was a terrorist to cover up their tracks. I figured the world might want to know the truth. [0-0] Well, depending how this conversation goes, that could always change. [0-0] Don't make me grumpy.
CINE_DIARY03B_KATE=[0-0] You rescued Amy Ferrero at the Ground Zero operation. We know that she downloaded classified Monarch documents. Documents regarding our plans, the CFR, the Lifeboat Protocol. We believe you're in possession of these stolen files.[0-0] You never released the documents to the public.
CINE_DIARY03B_SERENE=[0-0] Sofia. [0-0] She kept me grounded. Reminded me of the reason I created the Lifeboat. The parts of humanity that were worth protecting. I trusted her. More than I've ever trusted anybody. Every time I received my treatment I put my life in her hands.[0-0] And every time she has been slowly taking it away from me. All these years she claimed to be looking for a permanent cure. In reality, she's been searching for a way to destroy not only me, but everything I've built... and she finally found it. [0-0] Martin's evidence makes that much entirely clear. She didn't do this alone. There are others. I will find her. Even if I have to torture every fucking scientist in this company. I will find her. She will answer for what she's done.
CINE_DIARY04_JACK=[0-0] He sold our family home to finish building the countermeasure. He never told me. When I found out I was furious. I hadn't talked the guy for almost three years. He stopped answering the phone. I figured he was deep into drugs, gambling, something bad. [0-0] I never gave him the chance. I found him outside that workshop and tore right into him. Blamed him for everything that went wrong between us. I could see in his eyes he wanted to tell me. But I wouldn't let him. It was the last straw, you know? [0-0] If I'd handled the situation a bit better... 
CINE_DIARY04_KATE=[0-0] You said you'd been to William's workshop before. What brought you there?[0-0] Did you discover the truth?[0-0] Let's move on to the next question. 
CINE_DIARY05B_JACK=[0-0] He wanted me to understand. Why he did what he did. What he was trying to do.[0-0] Maybe he should've thought of that before killing my brother.
CINE_DIARY08_KATE=[0-0] Are you aware of the Lifeboat Protocol?[0-0] The project was meant to assure our continued survival past the End of Time. [0-0] Those 300 people were selectively chosen to take refuge in order to provide our best chance at developing a permanent solution to restoring the Joyce field, while protecting the human race against the threats that would arrive with the End of Time. You stole the countermeasure, the CFR, the device necessary to run the Lifeboat. You effectively sabotaged Monarch's survival plan. Knowing what you know now, do you stand by your decision?
CINE_DIARY09_JACK=[0-0] No.[0-0] No.[0-0] You know the answer to that. I don't have time for this.[0-0] "Traitors." You say Monarch's mission is to save us from the "dangers of the future." Beth devoted her entire life to that cause. The one thing that could stop the Fracture... her sacrifice is what kept it safe. Everything you built, everything, was based on that device, the device she fucking died to preserve, and she's the traitor? Your plan was flawed from the start, and you blame her because she found a better way.[0-0] You owe everything to her.[0-0] Next question.
CINE_DIARY09_KATE=[0-0] I want you to tell me if any of these names ring a bell. Fiona Miller.[0-0] Charlie Wincott.[0-0] Beth Wilder.[0-0] These names are all connected. It's hard to believe you would be aware of one, but not the others. They're all traitors to Monarch, linked by--[0-0] I thought you "barely knew her."
CINE_DIARY10_JACK=[0-0] Yeah, I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.[0-0] Okay. Stop me if you've heard this one before.[0-0] Bartender says: "We don't serve time-travelers here." A time-traveler walks into a bar.[0-0] No? Nothing, not even a smile?[0-0] Tough audience.
CINE_J2_100_120_SERENE=[0.6-4.5] The future used to be so clear when I was reliving the past. [5.4-8.3] Once I caught up to the moment I had left, that ended. [9.1-13.5] All I've had to go on since then are the plan... and the visions.[15.5-24.1] I knew Jack would come to me. I'd seen that. But I didn't know why, exactly. Or how it would end.[28.1-31.9] My visions of the future aren't always clear, but they don't lie.[37.7-41.4] We've spent seventeen years looking for it, and he finds it in less than a day?[43.6-48] Still, we know it's out there somewhere... and we don't know what his brother managed to tell him.[55.45-60] Maybe. But the machine is out there. It's in our interest to find where. [61-63.7] And if Jack knows, I have to talk to him.
CINE_J2_200_000A_SERENE=[1.5-4.5] Martin, I'm afraid you're going to have to cover for me at the speech tonight.[9-11] Jack and I have a lot of catching up to do.
CINE_J2_200_000B_JACK=[15-16.3] You're all heart, Moneybags.
CINE_J2_300_000_SERENE=[8.7-10.2] I've seen where this leads...[12.9-20.1] I've been to the End of Time. And I've escaped it, all the way to 1999. When it all started.[21.3-23] I've tried to change things.[23.7-26.8] But by trying, I only made them happen in the first place.
CINE_J3_100_120_HATCH=[26.6-27.1] Paul?[42.6-47.5] Paul. This is your illness talking. I'm on your side.[55-56.2] Easy. You're all--[62.2-70.3] We did all we could. But there are forces within Monarch working against you. And I believe Burke was just the tip of the iceberg. It wasn't just Joyce that did this.
CINE_J3_100_120_MONARCH_GUARD=[72-77.8] Sir? Uh, we've recovered Dr. Amaral's laptop. We have it set up over there if you want to take a look.
CINE_J3_100_120_SERENE=[3.3-8.7] This... thing... growing inside me.[10.9-13.5] I've been fighting it for six hard years.[17.15-26.5] Dr. Amaral was developing a cure for the Chronon Syndrome. She was the only one who could administer the treatments that kept my sickness at bay.[28.4-31.8] And Jack had taken her away from me.[37.9-42.55] How the fuck did this happen, Martin? How is it possible they managed to take her?[57.8-63] They took her. Without Sofia, there's no chance of a cure.[78.2-79.3] I'll be right there.
CINE_J3_200_000A_HATCH=[9.4-13.25] Fine. I'll take the laptop to the science department.[21.9-22.9] ...I see.
CINE_J3_200_000B_HATCH=[20.4-26.3] Actually, I've already got something on that front. They just pulled this from the security feed.[31.9-32.6] Who?[40.8-55] We got too big for you to screen everybody personally. And we didn't have an ID on her... until now. Beth Wilder. She's one of our operatives. We've already got a kill team after--[60.4-65.5] I told you, Paul, we can't trust our own people. Who knows how deep this goes?
CINE_J3_300_000_BETH=[0-0] <grunts>
CINE_J3_300_000_SERENE=[1.4-2.4] ...when it all started.[11.95-19.15] She'd been here the whole time, working against me from the inside. And she wasn't the only one.
CINE_J4_100_000_MONARCH_TROOPER=[65.9-71.15] Mr. Serene? Sorry to disturb you, sir, but I have that clean-up report on Dr. Kim's lab you wanted.
CINE_J4_100_000_SERENE=[1.5-4.15] I don't have much time left, I know.[7.1-20.3] I spent seventeen years working it out, planning it, building Monarch. Because I knew what was coming, and I knew it couldn't be stopped. But what I built has been turned against me.[23-26.9] What is the point in saving them if I can't trust them?[33.6-37.1] I'm slipping away... into pain and rage.[39.5-41.7] The sickness is accelerating.[45.2-64.2] The CFR... it has cost me so much. But I have harnessed its power. And with it, my plan will work. With it, I will keep the lights on when the world goes dark.[71.6-75.6] Meet me in my office, soldier. I'll be there when I've sealed the CFR chamber.
CINE_J4_120_000_MONARCH_TROOPER=[14.6-18] Uh, sir? I didn't catch that.[24.4-28.9] Sir? Er, are you planning to... uh, use that?
CINE_J4_120_000_SERENE=[5.3-9.15] One of my treatments... but it's damaged.[11.8-13.7] Is it safe to use?[18.5-23.7] Or is it a trap? Another betrayal?
CINE_J4_200_000A_MONARCH_TROOPER=[8-8.8] Sir?[13.5-14.3] Yes, sir.
CINE_J4_200_000A_SERENE=[9.5-13.65] Thank you, I'll be right down. Dismissed.[41.2-42.7] Mnnngh.[61.9-70.1] I feel... more clear-headed. Calmer.[73.3-75.3] But it won't last.[78.4-83.4] I need to work fast. While I still can.[93.25-95] Bradbury swimming pool.
CINE_J4_200_000B_MONARCH_TROOPER=[11.3-13.5] Sir? Are you all right?[15.3-19.2] Sir... you ordered us to go through Dr. Kim's lab, find what we can--[20.6-21.6] You, sir![22.3-23.5] What the fuck!
CINE_J4_200_000B_SERENE=[8.6-10.1] Who put you up to this?[13.9-15.6] WHO ARE YOU WORKING FOR?[16.8-18.1] LIAR![34.15-35.3] No...[43.15-50.5] Any of them... it could be any of them. I need to be careful.[60.5-62.1] Bradbury swimming pool.

CINE_RADIO_5P2A_2010_BOBBY_RADFORD=[0-0] Hey, Bobby Radford coming at you on Fourth of July, and what a fine day it is, too. Things are looking up for Riverport. Huh, don't believe me? Just look at that shiny new Monarch building going up. That's a big deal for this town. Sure, I know there's been complaints. Talking about how Monarch's tearing down this or that, taking over the mom and pop spots. Making Riverport more corporate.[0-0] Huh, some of that's happening, it ain't all good. A huge corporation like that, you know they're all about power and profit. But I say, hold on there. Put it in perspective. This town's been miserable for a long time. A long time. When our shipbuilding industry took that final nose dive, we hit one hell of a slump. A lot of people I know been unemployed for years now, and that's hard. But Monarch's here. And they're starting to change that, big time.[0-0] So they ain't perfect. So what? It beats the alternative. I wanna be optimistic about this. It ain't wrong to have a little hope for the future. I wanna believe that this is capitalism working as intended, you know? The American way, you could say.
CINE_RADIO_5P2B_2010_BOBBY_RADFORD=[0-0] Hey, Riverport! I'm pretty sure you folks are having a better time than I am -- ol' Bobby's still stuck in the studio just a little while longer, whereas all of you folks are out there enjoying what I hope are spectacular 4th of July parties. [0-0] So, set off some fireworks. Eat a little too much. Drink until every joke you hear's funny. And spend some time with your loved ones. Appreciate the good things in your life, y'know? This country ain't perfect, but it's still pretty damn good, and it's sure as hell worth celebrating. [0-0] I'm about done here myself, and I can't wait to get home, crack open a beer or three, and kick back with the people I love most. We're gonna appreciate that this year's better than last year, and we've all got good things to look forward to. And isn't that what today's really all about? Being safe and free. Not having to be afraid. Knowing that we've made a future for ourselves, and that it's all going to be all right.[0-0] Yeah. Riverport, this is Bobby Radford, signing off for tonight, and wishing all of you a happy Independence Day.
CINE_RADIO_A1P1_BOBBY_RADFORD=[0-0] Hey, it's Bobby Radford here on the tail end of the night shift. How you doing, Riverport? Burning the midnight oil? Just waking up or you getting ready for bed?[0-0] Maybe you're asleep. I wouldn't blame ya; not a lot going down in downtown tonight -- unless you're at the Riverport University campus, where the protest against Monarch Solutions is still going on. Y'see, Monarch wants to knock down the old campus library and put up a brand new building. The protesters are saying that building's a part of our heritage and we don't need Monarch gobbling up yet another bit of Riverport.[0-0] Personally? I'm with the activists on this one. I'm sure Monarch's new building would be big and shiny, but, well, c'mon, who gives a shit? I love that old library, even if it is kinda falling apart. I like things with character, and Monarch... hell, they've got all the character of a brand new smartphone. Sure, call me a hipster, whatever. I just think you don't have to be a smug douchebag with organic sneakers and an ironic Nascar cap to prefer a nice corner restaurant with personality to yet another Olive Garden, you know?[0-0] Still, much as it pains me to say this, I think this is a done deal. Monarch's gonna take that library down tomorrow, no matter what we say. Might as well pack it up and go home, get ready for the next fight. 'Cause you know they aren't done with our town yet, right?
CINE_RADIO_A1P3_BOBBY_RADFORD=[0-0] Well, here I thought it was going to be a quiet night, but it sounds like things have taken a real bad turn down at the anti-Monarch protest at Riverport university. I don't know exactly what's going on, but I've just heard about security personnel in the employ of Monarch Solutions detaining students... and some reports of gunfire. Now, I don't wanna jump the gun here, this is unconfirmed, and obviously I don't know the details, but no matter how you slice it, it sounds like a bad scene.[0-0] You know I'm not a big fan of Monarch or how they do things, but at the same time, I hope nobody's going overboard with this protest thing. It's just a goddamn building, people, it ain't worth anybody getting shot over.[0-0] Although, if they are shooting people over it... that's some heinous bullshit right there. Either way, I've got a feeling this is gonna get a whole lot worse before it gets better.[0-0] Stay safe, people.
CINE_RADIO_A3P1_PR_THERESA_SEDMAK=[0-0] Hello, Riverport, this is Theresa Sedmak, happy to spend this fine evening with you good folks. We're gonna have a good time, but if you're keeping an eye on the in crowd, you know we're not going to be the only ones! The very exciting, very exclusive Monarch gala is tonight at their beautiful mansion on Gull Island.[0-0] Of course, the event's invite only, and when they say exclusive, they really mean it. Word is, even confirmed A-listers have had a lot of trouble securing an invitation. Predictably, rumors are already circulating -- some people are saying that this is not just a party, that there might be an important announcement about Monarch's future coming up. Lots of people are anxious to get in on the ground floor on whatever the new thing -- if there is one! -- might be. It's no secret that when Monarch Solutions makes a move, it pays off.[0-0] Well, I suppose we'll just have to wait and see! You'll hear about it as soon as I do, listeners. In the meantime, those of us with a view of the river will be able to enjoy the fireworks show, which is bound to be spectacular.
CINE_RADIO_A3P2_HARDLINE_BOBBY_RADFORD=[0-0] And you're back for some quality time with Bobby Radford. Hope you're doing okay tonight, Riverport; it's been a pretty freaky day, and I'm kinda hoping things'll calm down now. I'd sure like to go back to normal, put these events behind us...[0-0] Personally, I feel like that ain't gonna happen, y'know? Ain't no going back to normal. Back in the day, I used to think that Monarch was good news for this town. They brought in a lot of jobs, and I dunno if you remember it, but man, did we need those jobs bad. Unfortunately, that came with a price tag, and we're paying for it now. Now, they're playing those classic corporate games where they keep screwing us. And they lie about it. And they deny responsibility. And even if somebody manages to nail their asses to the wall for it, they'll just lawyer up and wiggle off the hook somehow.[0-0] Hell, that's business as usual in America, folks. You get used to that. It's what they all do, in the end, one way or another. But Monarch...[0-0] I keep flashing back to how Monarch's security boys worked people over at the university. How maybe they did worse than that.[0-0] Shit, we're used to cops getting away with that. But these guys don't even have badges. That kinda thing... it just don't sit right with Bobby, Riverport. And it shouldn't sit right with you. So get off your ass and do something about it. Call your councilman now!
CINE_RADIO_A3P2_PR_GAIL=[0-0] Hey, this is Gail.[0-0] Uh, well, my boyfriend was at the protest last night, and he hasn't come home--
CINE_RADIO_A3P2_PR_SPENCER=[0-0] Hey, Theresa, it's Spencer.[0-0] Not much! Cooking spaghetti, listening to you! Just wanted to say hi to my husband, starting his shift at Fire Station 12.
CINE_RADIO_A3P3_HARDLINE_GREG_LAWRENCE=[0-0] Yeah, I’m out here by Port Donnelly Bridge. Monarch’s got the whole goddamn place locked down. Now they’re trying to inspect my truck--[0-0] Yeah! That’s -- that’s what I said, but they’re not letting me go--
CINE_RADIO_A3P3_PR_KEN_BUKOWSKI=[0-0] Hey, I just wanna give a shout-out to my little guy. Hey, Ben, hope you’re listening![0-0] He'll be up reading those Hunger Games books, if I know him. But, uh, yeah, I'm just out here in the control booth overlooking the bridge. Monarch’s got a roadblock set up, checking all the cars as they go through. It's all very well organized. I’ve got a nice young fellow from Monarch up here, Darren, doing some kind of lookout from above.[0-0] He’s not a coffee drinker, so there must be something wrong with him. Heh heh. No, but we’re in good hands, uh, even though it's not cops at the roadblock...[0-0] I... guess that makes sense...
CINE_RADIO_A3P3_PR_THERESA_SEDMAK=[0-0] For those of you just tuning in, the manhunt continues as authorities search for Jack Joyce, the suspect in last night's university terror attack. Joyce may also have been involved in a firefight at the Monarch mansion on Gull Island approximately thirty minutes ago. On the line we have Ken Bukowski, a bridge operator for the Port Donnelly Bridge. Ken, what can you tell us about the situation out there?[0-0] Isn't it past his bedtime?[0-0] Yes, Ken, Monarch is working to assist the police in the hunt for Jack Joyce. I know some people have asked, "does Monarch have the authority to do this?" Well, my question is, if not Monarch, then who? I think we need to recognize that we are currently in a state of crisis. Why isn't Joyce behind bars? If the police are overwhelmed, then I say we take all the help we can get. Monarch is the only thing keeping this city safe, am I right, Ken?[0-0] You bet it does. I suggest we stop asking why they’re helping us and start helping them. But that's just me; we’re opening the lines for your thoughts, Riverport... right after this.
CINE_RADIO_A6P1_HARDLINE_BOBBY_RADFORD=[0-0] Oh, man, there's so much crazy stuff happenin'. Reports of more and more accidents are comin' in so fast we're being overwhelmed by 'em. Folks, I don't know what's going on, and I don't mind telling you I'm fuckin' scared, because this fuckin' city, hell, the whole world--[0-0] Oh, shut the fuck up, Barry, they can fire me for saying "fuck" if they want to, do you honestly think I give a rat's ass at this point? I'm tryin' to fuckin' tell people what's happenin', and you ain't helpin', so get off my dick![0-0] Sorry. Sorry, people, I don't know why this is happenin', but there's reports from all over the world. Car accidents, plane crashes, just -- just things going haywire, for no reason, like -- like the bridge crash we had. It's scaring the shit out of me. Please, if you're listening, don't go outside if you can help it, don't go on anything that moves. No cars, no trains, no nothin'. Seems like everythin' -- well, everythin' that moves can be dangerous now, and nobody sees it comin'. I know it's crazy, but we got hospitals filling up all over Riverport. And it's bad, and it's happening everywhere, and...[0-0] And we're gonna make some calls and try and find out what's going on. We'll let you know as soon as we get any new information. Just -- just be real fuckin' careful, people. Stay inside, try to be safe, okay?[0-0] Okay.
CINE_RADIO_A6P1_PR_THERESA_SEDMAK=[0-0] Hello, Riverport, this is Theresa Sedmak. Um, as I'm sure you're aware, things are... uh, very chaotic right now, all over Riverport, and in the rest of the world. There's an epidemic of collisions of some kind happening, car accidents, air collisions, all eerily similar to the, um, um...[0-0] ...to the Port Donnelly bridge crash we experienced earlier, where nobody seems to see these accidents coming until they happen. I -- I personally witnessed a car... slamming into three people, a -- a family, as they were crossing the street, and I do not know where that car came from. The street was clear, and suddenly it -- um--[0-0] The situation is -- is being addressed by Monarch Solutions, who are responding to the crisis by--[0-0] I can't do this. This isn't worth it, they didn't tell me it would be like this. They knew, didn't they? Those sons of bitches knew, and the way they were talking, they--[0-0] I'm sorry, I have to go. I -- I can't stay here. I have to go home.
CINE_RADIO_A6P2_BOBBY_RADFORD=[0-0] Hey, night owls, it's your boy Bobby. Listen, if anybody's at the protest at the Riverport University, I'd sure love to hear from you. I'm hearing some pretty disturbing things, so give me a call here at the studio, I think we could all use a firsthand account of what's goin' down.[0-0] I've, uh... actually tried to call some people I know down there, but my calls don't seem to be getting through... anyway, our lines are open.[0-0] We'll be right back.

LOADING_HINT_007=Time Blast {@TIME_POWER_BLAST} is a powerful attack that can affect multiple enemies, but charging it leaves Jack vulnerable. Choose your moment carefully.
LOADING_HINT_008=Time Dodge {@TIME_POWER_DODGE} towards a lightly-armored enemy to knock them back.
LOADING_HINT_009=You will automatically take cover when you move next to a suitable object.

LOADING_HINT_017=The Time Shield {@TIME_POWER_SHIELD} will shove weaker enemies away from you and stagger them.
LOADING_HINT_018=The Quantum Break show is your window into what's going on within Monarch Solutions.
LOADING_HINT_019=When a Time Stop bubble bursts, all of the bullets fired into it are released at once, resulting in massive damage.
LOADING_HINT_020=Enemies lose track of you if you Time Dodge {@TIME_POWER_DODGE} out of their field of vision.
LOADING_HINT_021=Monarch's Striker units have chronon technology that allows them to move across the battlefield in the blink of an eye.
LOADING_HINT_022=Time Blast {@TIME_POWER_BLAST} has a wide area of effect.
LOADING_HINT_023=Juggernaut units are so heavily armored that a frontal assault is a waste of time. Try finding a weak spot.
LOADING_HINT_024=Chronon dampeners cancel out your powers. Disable them or leave their area of effect to regain the use of your powers.
LOADING_HINT_025=Some enemies carry portable chronon dampeners. Your powers won't affect them.
LOADING_HINT_026=Switch between weapons with {@INVENTORY_RIGHT}, {@INVENTORY_DOWN}, and {@INVENTORY_LEFT}.
LOADING_HINT_027=Jack Joyce and Paul Serene have been best friends just about as long as either of them can remember.
LOADING_HINT_028=The city of Riverport was in dire financial straits before Monarch Solutions came in and started making heavy investments locally.
LOADING_HINT_029=Dr. William Joyce is Jack's older brother. He's a genius physicist, but also rather eccentric and not the easiest man to get along with.
LOADING_HINT_030=After Jack and William's parents were killed in a car crash when Jack was just a young teenager, William became Jack's guardian. It wasn't a role he was very well suited for.
LOADING_HINT_031=Jack and William had been at odds for years, but when William wasted Jack's inheritance on the research he obsessed about, they had a major falling out that caused Jack to leave Riverport in 2010.
LOADING_HINT_032=Beth Wilder works for Monarch Solutions, but she has a mysterious agenda of her own.
LOADING_HINT_033=The old Riverport drydock and industrial area was bought out by Monarch in 2010. It's been off limits to the public since then.
LOADING_HINT_034=Monarch owns Gull Island. They built their R&D facility into its old WW2 fortifications.
LOADING_HINT_035=Chronon Technicians carry chronon grenades that will temporarily cancel your powers. Move away from them before they detonate!
LOADING_HINT_036=If you're badly hurt, the Time Shield {@TIME_POWER_SHIELD} can buy you some breathing room while you recover.
LOADING_HINT_038=Remember that you can upgrade your powers in the Upgrade menu.
LOADING_HINT_039=Mix it up when you're using your time powers -- each one of them has an independent cooldown, so you can string them together.
LOADING_HINT_040=You can change the game's difficulty at any time in the Options menu.
LOADING_HINT_041=Avoid unstable objects within stutters. They can be highly dangerous.
LOADING_HINT_042=You can use your time powers to stop or avoid unstable objects.
LOADING_HINT_043=Time powers can stop unstable objects, but only up to a certain size. While the object is stopped, it will not do any damage.

LOADING_HINT_045=Click {@TOGGLE_SIDE} to move the camera to the character's other shoulder when aiming.
LOADING_HINT_046=Monarch is using the area they call Ground Zero to harvest vast quantities of the chronon particles that power their technology.
LOADING_HINT_047=For years, Paul Serene has been running Monarch Solutions from behind the scenes. Martin Hatch, his right-hand man, has long been its public face.
LOADING_HINT_048=Dr. Sofia Amaral is the only one who knows how to prepare the treatments for Paul Serene's Chronon Syndrome.
LOADING_HINT_049=As stutters become more frequent and violent, time becomes unsynchronized, leading to deadly collisions between moving objects -- like vehicles and pedestrians. Or ships and bridges.
LOADING_HINT_050=When Jack was affected by the pulse from the time machine, he became a living chronon particle generator. This gives him his powers, and allows him to remain active in stutters.
LOADING_HINT_051=The Meyer-Joyce field permeates our entire universe. It generates chronon particles, which allow time to exist. The Fracture in the field is causing the stutters in time.
LOADING_HINT_052=If the Fracture in time is not repaired, it will eventually lead to the End of Time -- a permanent state of stutter, in which nothing can ever move again.
LOADING_HINT_054=Jack has been away from Riverport for six years. A lot has changed while he was abroad.
LOADING_HINT_055=Beth Wilder has dedicated her entire life to her mission.

LOADING_HINT_057=Paul Serene is in charge of Project Promenade, an ambitious physics project at Riverport University. He's a businessman, not a scientist.
LOADING_HINT_058=The protest at Riverport University is in response to Monarch Solutions' plans to demolish an old library building, which the activists feel is a part of the university's history and character.
LOADING_HINT_059=Monarch Solutions is a powerful and wealthy multinational corporation, headquartered in Riverport, MA.
LOADING_HINT_060=When a stutter in time occurs, normal people are completely unaware of it -- but they might see the consequences of actions taken during it once it ends.
LOADING_HINT_061=All of Monarch's chronon technology requires chronon particles to work.
LOADING_HINT_064=Don't let yourself get surrounded by enemies. Powers like Time Dodge {@TIME_POWER_DODGE} allow you to move quickly to get some breathing room.
LOADING_HINT_065=Your powers won't work within a chronon dampener's area of effect, not even if you yourself are outside the dampener field.
LOADING_HINT_067=Dr. Sofia Amaral is in charge of Monarch's research efforts. She replaced Dr. Kim, who died under mysterious circumstances.
LOADING_HINT_068=Liam Burke was in the Monarch Chronon Striker training program, but he washed out before completing it.
LOADING_HINT_069=Clarice Ogawa is in command over Monarch's field operations. She's a constant presence on Monarch comms.
LOADING_HINT_070=Charlie Wincott's computer skills have been vital in establishing Monarch control over Riverport.
LOADING_HINT_071=The time machine only allows time travel within its own lifespan; you can't travel past its point of activation or destruction.
LOADING_HINT_072=Movement in space along the time machine's corridor is also movement through time. A traveller in the corridor is literally walking in time.
LOADING_HINT_073=Fiona Miller has been helping Beth Wilder to gather sensitive information from within Monarch.
LOADING_HINT_074=At its heart, the time machine really is just the machine's core. Move the core, you move the machine; everything around it, including the corridor, is essentially just its user interface.
LOADING_HINT_075=If you aren't sure where to go next, look for yellow materials and markings in the environment to guide you.

Anyway, they got Liam Burke hunting him down right now, so I think it’s safe to say Joyce is fucked. ¤\n¤\nOff the record, I heard Paul Serene has been investigating a potential traitor within Monarch. Somebody’s been accessing all kinds of confidential information. Remember that research Dr. Amaral was doing to find a permanent cure for Serene’s sickness? Rumor has it somebody sabotaged the tests.

I have a hunch you feel the same way. I’ve been allowed a lot of freedom to come and go in my position, but it comes at a cost of very low clearance. Most members of the team know something I don’t and they’re not eager to share. Tomorrow’s operation is more than a simple retrieval mission. There are dates and times marked with detailed events that are expected to come to pass. I’ve seen charts with “Fracture – 4:15am” labeled.  It’s way too much detail for a plan, it’s like it’s all been mapped out. How?¤\n¤\nSomething big is coming. I can feel it. They told us our directive is to protect our world from dangers that lie ahead. If that’s so then why do I get the feeling there’s something coming that we’re doing absolutely nothing to stop?

Os_a2p2_040_BODY=Hey Dr. Amaral,¤\n¤\nWe haven’t talked too much but I’m one of Serene’s guys from Reaper Squad. Working around all this time tech stuff (or chronon tech you call it I guess?) got me real inspired so I started writing a screenplay. There’s a lot of science talk in here so I want a scientist to check it and make sure it kind of makes sense. Would you mind taking a look? Thanks!¤\n¤\nHere is the first half:¤\n¤\n¤\n¤\nTIME KNIFE¤\nWritten By Bruce Livingstone¤\nACT ONE¤\nINT. OFFICE – NIGHT ¤\n¤\nBRUCE SAVAGE stands in his office. He is sexually attractive.¤\n¤\nSomebody knocks on Bruce’s door and he opens it. It’s a SCIENTIST LADY. She looks like a librarian with glasses but she is actually a scientist. You can tell because she has a lab coat.¤\n¤\nLADY SCIENTIST:¤\nHelp me.¤\n¤\nBRUCE: ¤\nOkay.¤\n¤\nLADY SCIENTIST: ¤\nTake this knife because some bad apples are trying to steal it and it is very important.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nOkay.¤\n¤\nLADY SCIENTIST:¤\nWhat is your name handsome? ¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nI’m Bruce. Let’s shake hands.¤\n¤\nBruce and Lady Scientist shake hands. ¤\n¤\nLADY SCIENTIST: ¤\nWow. You almost broke my hand with that handshake. You are definitely a tough guy. ¤\n¤\nShe is impressed with Bruce’s strength. She looks at his large biceps like they are delicious pieces of ham but she doesn’t want to eat them. ¤\n¤\nLADY SCIENTIST: ¤\nHere is the knife.¤\n¤\nThe Lady Scientist hands Bruce the knife. It looks mostly like a knife but also like a time machine because it is both a knife and a time machine but Bruce doesn’t know that yet. ¤\n¤\nGOONS break through the windows and shoot the scientist lady. She dies.¤\n¤\nSCIENTIST LADY:¤\nAvenge me.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nOkay. ¤\n¤\nBruce kills the goons with his legs by doing lots of kicking at them. They are dead real quick.¤\n¤\nBRUCE: ¤\nLooks like I got a LEG UP on you guys. ¤\n¤\nThe audience probably laughs here so Bruce waits to deliver his next line for around five seconds so that everybody has calmed down.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nWhat is so special about this knife?¤\n¤\nBruce stabs the knife into his chair. The chair disappears. ¤\n¤\nBRUCE: ¤\nThe chair disappeared.¤\n¤\nHe looks at a picture on his wall which is a big photograph from 1932 with lots of people from 1932 in it. Bruce’s chair is in the picture.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nInteresting. My chair traveled back in time to 1932 when I stabbed it. When I stab things they travel through time. That explains why this knife looks like a knife but also like a time machine, because it is both. ¤\n¤\nBruce’s real goofy friend from across the hall runs into the room. He trips on something on the floor. His name is SLOBBO. He isn’t as fat as his name sounds. ¤\n¤\nSLOBBO:¤\nAwwww yyyeah! ¤\n¤\nThat is Slobo’s catch phrase and he says it in a real funny way. ¤\n¤\nSCIENTIST LADY:¤\nBruce, you saved my life. ¤\n¤\nThe Scientist Lady was only faking being dead. ¤\n¤\nSCIENTIST LADY:¤\nAre you married?¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nOnly to my job.¤\n¤\nSCIENTIST LADY: ¤\nI find that attractive but also respectable.  ¤\n¤\nShe kisses Bruce’s cheek. ¤\n¤\nSLOBBO: ¤\nWhat about MY cheek? Awwww maaaan.¤\n¤\nThat is Slobo’s other catch phrase, which he says in a different but equally funny way. ¤\n¤\nBruce waits a few seconds for the audience to stop laughing before speaking.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nWait.

I knew you were real tough so you could kill them easy but I don’t respect you as an employee so I always make you do the shitty jobs even though you’ve been working at my company more than most of the other guys and are real smart. Also I don’t like you because my girlfriend finds you sexually attractive. ¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nNow I understand. ¤\n¤\nPAUL MARINE:¤\nGive me my time knife back. ¤\n¤\nPaul Marine snaps his fingers and seventy-three goons surround Bruce.¤\n¤\nPAUL MARINE:¤\nYou can’t kill seventy-three goons so just give up.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nI don’t have TIME for this.¤\n¤\nBruce stabs himself with the time knife and disappears. ¤\n¤\nSLOBBO:¤\nHe time traveled using the time knife. ¤\n¤\nBruce opens the door.

So I switched boots with somebody else. Say, Slobbo, whose boots are you wearing?¤\n¤\nSLOBBO:¤\nNOOOOOO!!¤\n¤\nSlobbo explodes. ¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nMy best friend.

Remember that the time knife is also a time machine. I am you from the future but I stabbed myself with the time knife in order to come back here and do all of this. ¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nBut we don’t look the same.¤\n¤\nPAUL MARINE:¤\nThat is a good point and I am glad you brought it up. First I time travelled 700 years into the future to a time where humans have created advanced technology that allows surgeries that completely change people’s faces and bodies. I had this surgery performed so that you wouldn’t be able to recognize me, but I am actually you in disguise. I can prove it because I know many things about you. ¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nLike what?¤\n¤\nPAUL MARINE:¤\nYou have a birth mark on your left ankle.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nI do have a birth mark on my left ankle. I am starting to believe you now. ¤\n¤\nPAUL MARINE:¤\nYou should, because even though I have a new body I kept that birth mark on my ankle so that when I met you I could prove that I was actually you from the future. I will show you.¤\n¤\nPaul lifts up the left leg of his pants but there is no birth mark. Instead there is an ankle holster for a gun. Paul pulls out the gun and aims it at Bruce.¤\n¤\nPAUL MARINE:¤\nI was lying this whole time. I’m not actually you. I was just saying all of that so that I could get my gun.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nSon of a bitch.¤\n¤\nPAUL MARINE:¤\nAlso in the future I melted the time knife and turned it into bullets. Those bullets are now in this gun, which means that I can shoot you but also send you through time all at once. Finally you will be out of my way so that I can marry my girlfriend Sofine later today before you are able to tell her that I’m a real shitty guy.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nI didn’t know you were getting married today.¤\n¤\nPAUL MARINE:¤\nI know. My girlfriend Sofine made an invitation for you because she admires you and thinks you’re attractive but I destroyed the invitation and then lied to her and said I gave it to you at work. But now I am here to give you a different invitation. To your funeral. ¤\n¤\nPaul Marine shoots at Bruce.¤\n¤\nSlobbo jumps in front of Bruce.¤\n¤\nSLOBBO:¤\nNOOOOOO!!¤\n¤\nSlobbo wasn’t actually dead. He jumps in front of the bullets and is shot several times. Now he’s actually dying. ¤\n¤\nSLOBBO:¤\nAvenge me.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nOkay.¤\n¤\nBruce goes to attack Paul Marine, but now Paul Marine has disappeared. ¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nHe’s gone.¤\n¤\nSlobbo is dying on the ground covered in blood.

Os_a2p2_115_BODY=Fiona¤\n¤\nI share your concern. Paul’s treatments are becoming increasingly ineffective and I hypothesize that the onset of the Fracture will increase the Chronon Syndrome’s rate of progression exponentially. I’ve been trying to take a more calculated approach at finding a permanent cure for Paul’s sickness, but Martin Hatch has shifted all the necessary resources into our tech division instead. I’m beginning to question his behavior. Every attempt I’ve made to discover a cure has been met with Martin’s red tape. Just between us, I do start to wonder if Martin even wants Paul to be cured. ¤\n¤\nI’ve looked into Martin’s past. He began work for Monarch in 2001, but I couldn’t find any records about his past, or any aspect of his life before then. It’s almost as if he just appeared out of nowhere. He was the only one present during the accident that claimed Dr. Kim’s life. I don’t want to jump to conclusions… but I do wonder what his agenda truly is.¤\n¤\nRegarding your question, unfortunately there is nothing of value in Dr. Kim’s lab aside from Paul Serene’s treatments and confidential files that would be of no use to your research.

Os_a2p2_118_BODY=Sir,¤\n¤\nGiven the very recent events at the dry docks, I now see exactly what you mean. Clearly, you were right about Burke’s loyalties being more fickle than they appeared. ¤\n¤\nOf course, we have plenty of unanswered questions about how it came to this. To begin with, I don’t see why Burke would be involved with Joyce. There’s no way he did it out of some kind of an altruistic urge, there has to be more to it. We know Burke didn’t divert Joyce’s transport, since whereabouts at that time are accounted for. So there has to be somebody else involved, too.¤\n¤\nI’m looking into it.¤\n¤\n---------------------------------------------------------¤\n¤\nTO: CLARICE OGAWA¤\nFROM: MARTIN HATCH¤\nDATE: OCT 8, 2016 – 9:47am¤\nSUBJECT: RE: Liam Burke’s status¤\n¤\nClarice,¤\n¤\nI understand why you consider Mr. Burke an asset to our future plans. Unfortunately, while he is an exceptional individual, he is less suitable for the kind of duties you have in mind than may be immediately obvious. I’ll explain.¤\n¤\nYes, he’s been trained as a Striker. But Mr. Burke WAS disqualified, and for good reason.¤\n¤\nThe men we have chosen to be Strikers have strict physical requirements, a certain moral flexibility, and the kind of killer instinct you have to be born with, cultivated to a fine degree. A ferocious knack for survival. Mr. Burke certainly has those qualities. He wasn't disqualified from the Striker program because he lacked them, or because he couldn’t wrap his head around the technical aspects of operating the technology; in fact, his performance was exceptional. So I fully agree with you that he’s an impressive operative.¤\n¤\nBut Strikers, by their very nature, have to be made aware of Project Lifeboat and its purpose, at least on a general level, and that means they have to able to accept its implications. Unfortunately, Mr. Burke has a deep attachment to his wife, and the fact is that even if we brought Mr. Burke in, that wouldn’t guarantee a spot for her in the program. To be blunt: we don’t need any more nurses, and we’re already at capacity overall. We need Mr. Burke, but we don’t need his wife. Mr. Burke would never accept that, particularly now that Mrs. Burke is pregnant. Therefore, it’s vital that he doesn’t understand the nature and scope of the threat we face.¤\n¤\nAs for having him play a role in other aspects of future developments, I suspect that despite his seemingly amoral nature, Mr. Burke may have other qualms he’s not consciously aware of. If he ever has to truly make a choice between conflicting loyalties, he may take a stand on principle and elect to act against his own best interests.¤\n¤\nThat’s not a chance I’m willing to take.¤\n¤\n---------------------------------------------------------¤\n¤\nTO: MARTIN HATCH  ¤\nFROM: CLARICE OGAWA¤\nDATE: OCT 7, 2016 – 8:01pm¤\nSUBJECT: Liam Burke’s status¤\n¤\nSir,¤\n¤\nI’ve been thinking about Liam Burke. I know you’ve worked closely with him for a while now, and he’s been useful, but there are assignments we can’t use him for because of his insufficient security clearance. For instance, having to keep him in the dark about much of what will happen at the university – about the stutters we’re expecting, about where it’ll lead – makes him a far less effective field operative than I’d prefer and causes quite a bit of logistical difficulty, given that he’s still going to be a part of the operation. And frankly, it feels like wasted potential.¤\n¤\nI’d like you to consider the possibility of bringing Burke into the fold. He's completed most of the Striker training, and even though he didn’t finish the program, he made an impression on me as a tremendously capable asset. His service record is exemplary, and he has a well-earned reputation as somebody who gets things done, no questions asked.¤\n¤\nBy the same token, I would love to include Burke in our long-term plans. We could use a man like him in our corner, and I could deploy him far more effectively.¤\n¤\nLet me know what you think.

Os_a2p2_120_SUBJECT=Sudden Stop
Os_a2p2_125_BODY=Martin,¤\n¤\nFirst of all, I have to again register my objection. What you are having me do under the guise of a “psych evaluation” is a blatant violation of Liam Burke’s doctor-patient confidentiality, and the only reason I’m doing this is because you leave me no other choice. Now, I recognize that in the world to come, our current rules and legislation – even our standards of morality – may no longer be applicable, but we aren’t there yet. You and Mr. Serene are placing the long-term mental wellbeing of hundreds of individuals in my hands, and I’m telling you right now, if they don’t trust not only me, but the system that put all of us in our particular positions, there’s no way we can recover from it.¤\n¤\nOn to Burke. It is my considered professional opinion that the man is a bit of a powder keg. For all his calm exterior, he’s under tremendous pressure. I understand your reasoning for pulling him out of the Striker program, but what you have essentially done is instill in him a sense of encroaching doom. He doesn’t know the specifics, obviously; he didn’t make it far enough in the program to be briefed on that, but he knows that we’re preparing for a future threat that is somehow related to the flow of time being interrupted – and that there are dangers out there, dangers that we have specifically been training the Striker units for.¤\n¤\nThere are men who are content to merely follow orders and let others worry about the consequences. Burke is not one of them. He is willing to commit acts of violence without asking why, but don’t mistake that lack of qualms for blind obedience. Burke needs agency; he has a fundamental need to feel in control of his life, and you have put him in a position where that’s no longer possible for him. He’s good at seeing patterns and drawing accurate conclusions from the facts available to him, and he has deduced – quite correctly – that he was being trained for a specific scenario that Monarch believes will happen. He is also painfully aware of the fact that if and when that scenario arrives, he will not be a part of the solution. He understands the nature of the Striker suits, that they are only useful in a zero state situation – and he understands that in such a situation a man without a Striker suit is, essentially, dead. He doesn’t know about the Lifeboat protocol, obviously – but if he did, he’d then also know he’s not a part of it.¤\n¤\nEither way, the bottom line is that he’s in a hopeless situation. He fears that the end of the world is coming, and he knows that if it does, the only way he could survive is with the technology Monarch has denied him access to. He doesn’t understand the details, or even the exact nature of that end of the world, but that just makes it worse. Fear and lack of understanding breed tremendous anxiety, Mr. Hatch; he may not show it, but believe me, Burke feels it – for himself and for his family. (It may interest you to know that his wife is pregnant. You can understand how that adds to the pressure.)¤\n¤\nTo be honest, given the parameters we’re operating under, I don’t know how to resolve this. In Burke, you have a tremendously efficient operative, but you’ve put him in an impossible position. I believe he will remain effective as long as he doesn’t have reason to believe the scenario he fears is imminent, but once he believes it has arrived, all bets are off. That is, unless you can give him hope of survival – but at this point, resentment and suspicion are starting to turn into paranoia, and, frankly, I’m not sure he would trust either of us anymore.¤\n¤\nAnd speaking of trust, I recommend you think about what I said in my opening paragraph, Martin. Our greatest challenge – and greatest assets – in the subjective years to come won’t be technological, but all too human. Don’t make the mistake seeing people as just entries on a spreadsheet.

William Joyce, born and raised in Riverport, wasn’t satisfied with simply being a part of the discussion and decided to actively search for proof. His proposed research project led to him obtaining the highly prestigious Harold Steinberg Fund, with an estimated value of $150,000. ¤\n¤\nDr. William Joyce is officially the youngest recipient of the Harold Steinberg research grant to date. While the specifics of his research proposal remains confidential, it is likely that Joyce aims to demonstrate clear proof of the so-called Meyer-Joyce Field, as well as potential applications for the manipulation of this field. A research timeline has been established with milestones that point to early 1999 as the period when this research will be ready for public unveiling. ¤\n¤\nWe will continue to follow William Joyce’s story as part of our Riverport Rising series.¤

Os_a3p1_015_BODY=RIVERPORT COASTAL DEFENSES¤\n¤\nThe coastal defense installation of Riverport was commissioned on August 2, 1940, and completed in September, 1942, as America faced the realities of World War II. In addition to the fortifications and artillery, it also boasted an extensive tunnel system that linked Gull Island to the mainland, enabling free movement of personnel and materiel even under siege conditions. It was built in preparation for an attack on the United States that, fortunately, never came.¤\n¤\nThe original plan also called for the construction of a large naval base in Riverport to support the US Navy in the Atlantic, taking advantage of the local ship-building industry, but as the United States entered World War II after Pearl Harbor, a change in resourcing priorities led to those plans being scrapped.¤\n¤\nThis installation was in active use throughout the war, and the underground facilities continued to be used as a base for Navy intelligence work once World War II ended. The installation was decommissioned in 1961.

Os_a3p1_080_BODY=Greetings Lifeboat personnel,¤\n¤\nThe day has finally come to commence Phase 3 of our plan. Tonight, I will be hosting a gala to celebrate this monumental achievement, to which you are all invited. By now you have likely heard of the events that took place earlier today at Riverport University. Our path forward has not been impacted by this minor setback. We are ready for what comes next.¤\n¤\nYour part in this journey has not yet begun,  but the onset of the Fracture will bring with it new challenges that are worth reiterating. I am not able to go over many of these issues in detail at tonight’s gala because many guests will not have knowledge of the Lifeboat Protocol. As such, I am including a high level document outlining key points worth addressing: ¤\n¤\n1. The Path Forward – Our Journey Ahead¤\n2. Lifeboat Protocol – Status of the Survival Program¤\n3. Shifters – Dangers Awaiting Us at the End of Time¤\n4. R and D Tour – Our Future at Work¤\n¤\n1. THE PATH FORWARD¤\nWhen you were first chosen for the Lifeboat Protocol, you were sent a package illustrating in great detail several events that would come to pass. It was stressed that these events were unavoidable. Many of you were reluctant to believe this, but every single one of those events has since occurred, including, to our great regret, the onset of the Fracture. This provides empirical evidence of my knowledge and understanding of the future, and I trust it has dispelled your doubts. No future event that I have experienced can ever be prevented. This includes the End of Time. It cannot be avoided.¤\n¤\nHowever, it can be survived. ¤\n¤\nSurvival in the End of Time has been the primary mission of Monarch Solutions since its inception. Your loyalty to this cause will prove invaluable as we move forward. I know this isn’t easy, but in the face of immutable facts, sacrifices must be made in the name of our survival. From this point forward, we will have to start making those sacrifices at a rapid pace. While we do know the exact date and time at which the complete End of Time will occur, our knowledge about the escalation in stutters and time anomalies leading to it is far less complete. We do, however know that it will be dangerous.¤\n¤\nFor the first time in 17 years, we are entering a phase of the relative unknown. Adjustments will need to be made along the way, both in response to the effects of the Fracture’s progress, and to the less cosmic events that we will find ourselves in. We ask for your patience in this trying time.¤\n¤\n2. LIFEBOAT PROTOCOL¤\nYou are the chosen few who will survive the End of Time. When time stops, your journey will continue in the safety of the Lifeboat. The chronon particle harvesting operation is nearing completion. The Lifeboat has been confirmed to be able to run solely on that chronon power, as regulated by the Chronon Field Regulator. Current data indicates that the Lifeboat will remain sustainable for approximately 50 years – subjective years, of course, as no time at all will pass outside the Lifeboat.¤\n¤\nGiven the preliminary research we have achieved using the CFR, we estimate that it will take at least two subjective decades for the Lifeboat team to discover a permanent solution for the End of Time. Given the nature of the problem, this is of course highly speculative, and the solution could prove to be more elusive than we’re hoping.  However, by the time the Lifeboat Protocol is activated we are confident that we will be able to increase our chronon particle reserves and their sustainability to a point where we have a runtime of upwards of 200 subjective years. Or, to put it another way, if there is a solution to the End of Time, I am 100% confident that the Lifeboat team will have the necessary time to discover it.¤\n¤\n3. SHIFTERS¤\nWe briefed you all on the danger of Chronon Disrupted Wave Function Subjects, or what are now being referred to as “shifters.” We estimate that they will begin to emerge within stutters only as the End of Time nears. The Lifeboat has been tested and we can say with absolute certainty that the stutterproof technology will protect the Lifeboat from shifters. Using a living sample in Dr. Kim’s lab we have proven that shifters cannot manifest without the presence of a stutter. We will make sure that you are transported to the safety of the Lifeboat before they arrive.¤\n¤\nFloor 3 of the Lifeboat has been built to house the Monarch Solutions Striker and Juggernaut squads – a paramilitary unit trained to combat Shifters at the End of Time. Their presence will likely not concern you. However, in the event that travel outside the safety of the Lifeboat proves to be necessary for any reason, the Striker teams have been trained to navigate the End of Time and successfully eliminate Shifters. ¤\n¤\n4. R and D TOUR¤\nTonight we will be sending you VIP passes for the gala which will permit entry into our high-security R and D facility on Gull Island. Many of you are, of course, already intimately familiar with these areas, given your technological and scientific expertise, but those who aren’t will undoubtedly find it interesting. You are welcome to join a tour to view the various pieces of tech that Monarch has developed during Phase 2 to prepare for our journey forward. We welcome you to take this opportunity to see for yourself that every development necessary for the Lifeboat Protocol is completely on schedule.¤\n¤\nYour dedication to our cause will assure our survival. Dark times are coming, but you are the light at the end of the tunnel. You are humanity’s salvation and hope. Together we will survive.¤\n¤\n- Paul Serene

Os_a3p1_120_BODY=TO: R and D LEADS¤\nFROM: SOFIA AMARAL¤\nDATE: OCT 9, 2016 – 11:59am¤\nSUBJECT: The time machine¤\n¤\nHello,¤\n¤\nI have just been informed that the time machine core we obtained from the university has reached Monarch HQ safely, and is currently being installed into the new time machine corridor system we have constructed there.¤\n¤\nAs you know, the core of the time machine is the time machine; the corridor around it is merely the user interface. This means, of course, that once the installation work is complete, we have effectively moved the time machine from the university into the Monarch HQ. That said, we don’t intend to use it.¤\n¤\nLet me repeat that: there are no current plans to use the machine. We are not sure how safe it would be to use, given that its initial activation has caused the Fracture. I personally believe that now that the core has been activated, further use would be safe, but make no mistake: this is a hypothesis, not a proven fact. We know that the machine taps into the universal Meyer-Joyce field, and somehow that connection has caused the Fracture in the field, apparently because of a misconfiguration. We are looking into the specifics, but until we know for sure, it would be irresponsible to use the machine.¤\n¤\nHowever, having it in place gives us a degree of control. It allows us, in an emergency, to travel backwards (although we obviously can go no further than to the time of its activation, last night) or forwards as might be required. Obviously, being fully secured at our building’s restricted area on the top floor also means that nobody else can use the machine.¤\n¤\nI have to reiterate that the only person who may authorize the use of the time machine is Paul Serene. I do not have that authority; Martin Hatch does not have that authority. The only person who does is Mr. Serene. He takes this issue very seriously, and I strongly suggest that you do the same.¤\n¤\nDr. Sofia Amaral¤\nHead of Research
Os_a3p1_130_BODY=Greetings,¤\n¤\nIt has been brought to my attention that there is some confusion as to the reason for the upcoming evening gala on Gull Island. I understand that some feel that such a celebration is frivolous, even misguided, in the aftermath of last night’s events at Riverport University and the now-present, steadily advancing Fracture in time.¤\n¤\nThese concerns are understandable, but they are missing the bigger picture. Monarch Solutions is now entering a phase in which its true purpose will be fulfilled. We have finally arrived at the moment for which we have spent years preparing.¤\n¤\nThe purpose of this event is twofold.¤\n¤\nFirst of all, for those selected to be a part of the Lifeboat project as scientists, technicians, support personnel, or in some other role, it will be important to see and hear Paul Serene. Continued confidence in the survival program is vital for the continued  survival of Monarch, and, ultimately, the human race itself. This is particularly important given recent events; we need to present a desirable and reassuring counterpoint to the sacrifices we’ve had to make. Naturally, not everybody at the party will be among the chosen few, so a certain degree of informational hygiene will be required. I trust you will ensure that those reporting to you are informed precisely to the degree necessary.¤\n¤\nSecondly, for all of our autonomy and vast resources, Monarch is not functionally independent from the rest of society. In order for our plans to succeed, we will need the support and cooperation of the authorities and numerous business partners, even though they don’t know our true goals. A demonstration of power and confidence, as well as a clear message that Monarch has the will and the reach to fulfill our plans, will go a long way towards securing that support. This is particularly important given our recent hardline approach. We cannot weather the storm of public opinion without support from Riverport’s higher echelons – and if they consider us weak, or a liability, they may choose to probe deeper into our activities. This is precisely the kind of escalation we do not need at this crucial juncture.¤\n¤\nIn conclusion, this is a tremendously important event for the future of Monarch Solutions, and for the future itself.¤\n¤\nIf there are any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact me.¤\n¤\nMartin Hatch

Our PR blitz has been working well, but in order to maintain momentum, we must maintain an amicable relationship with Riverport’s leadership. Our entire approach is based on the idea of Monarch stepping in to assist the authorities, and being welcomed by citizens and city administration alike. Should the latter suddenly declare Monarch's help unwanted or unsanctioned, our entire strategy could collapse in just a few hours. That would be disastrous to our plans.¤\n¤\nIn conclusion, this is a tremendously important event for the future of Monarch Solutions, and for the future itself.¤\n¤\nIf there are any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact me.¤\n¤\nMartin Hatch

Os_a3p1_140_SUBJECT=FWD: Dream Journal 1
Os_a3p1_150_BODY=We’ve looked at the preliminary data on the frequency and severity of the stutters and crunched the numbers, and the results are alarming. Our original projection, which gave us years until the Fracture reached the point where time breaks down completely, does not match up with the progression of stutters we are experiencing. Put simply, the stutters are happening more and more frequently, clearly indicating that the Meyer-Joyce field is breaking down much faster than we thought. Taking the rate of acceleration, we can hypothesize that we might have as little as 24 hours until we reach the End of Time, or the point at which time stops, and no longer starts up again.¤\n¤\nWe do not know why the original projection was wrong, and why that data – which we do consider reliable, coming as it does from Mr. Serene – seems to entirely contradict our current findings. Regardless, the main issue seems clear: in order to achieve Monarch Solutions’ stated goals, the Lifeboat protocol should be activated ASAP.
Os_a3p1_150_SUBJECT=Projected Fracture Progression
Os_a3p1_160_BODY=SLIDE ONE: ¤\n¤\nMuch of what we know about the Shifters is theoretical, based on observations made by Mr. Serene and the limited experimentation we have been able to conduct on the only subject we have managed to capture.¤\n¤\nThey do not seem to have a stable physical presence; rather, the data we are gathering appears to be fragmented and contradictory, as if there were countless versions of the subject occupying the same space. Our current theory is that they somehow exist in a persistent state of quantum superposition – or, to put it another way, with reference to the famous “Schrödinger’s cat” thought experiment, the cat is both alive and dead at the same time.¤\n¤\nThe full mechanics and implications of this exceed our current understanding, but on a practical level, it seems to make them highly resistant to injury – it appears that even if the Shifter encounters deadly force, it may kill one of its aspects, but because it exists as multiple iterations of itself, including iterations that were not killed by the force, it doesn’t stop.¤\n¤\nCurrent theory suggests that the only way to stop a Shifter is to cause its wave function to collapse from the superposition to a single eigenstate. In practical terms, the Shifter must be affected with deadly force enough times for it to run out of healthy versions of itself. As such, direct confrontation with a Shifter should be a last resort.¤\n¤\nSLIDE TWO:¤\n¤\nContact with a Shifter is extremely dangerous. We know that they are essentially mobile repositories of vast amounts of chronon particles, and that they can only exist in a zero state – an area which has been depleted of chronon particles, typically by a fault in the Meyer-Joyce field that encompasses the universe. Colloquially, we refer to these as “stutters” in time. We also know that Shifters are hostile to any source of chronon particles other than themselves within stutters, so any chronon active individual within a stutter may find themselves targeted by Shifters. It appears that movement in stutters – by which we mean the very movement of particles within the space in which time flows, not merely the movement of an individual – disturbs them, and they respond with considerable aggression.¤\n¤\nAs discussed previously, Shifters are extremely resistant to damage. They are also quite physically formidable, but their biggest threat is the distortion field around them. Its exact nature is unknown, but we know it warps the properties of the space surrounding them, exerting great physical stress and unpredictable forces on its surroundings. Again, in practical terms: close proximity to a Shifter may be fatal even if no actual physical contact takes place.¤\n¤\nSLIDE THREE:¤\n¤\nThe stutterproofing technology Monarch Solutions has advanced offers solid protection against Shifters; time flows normally within a stutterproofed area, so Shifters simply cannot exist within them. Therefore, as long as stutterproofing remains active, Shifters are not a problem. However, stutterproofing of large outside areas is not feasible, given our chronon particle budget, so we have developed other technology to defend against Shifters: the chronon dampeners.¤\n¤\nA chronon dampener works by annihilating free-floating chronon particles within a specificed area. As Shifters’ forms are hypersaturated with chronon particles, they cannot enter an area in which a chronon dampener is active without their wave function collapsing. Therefore, our operatives in the field have a solid portable defense against Shifters.¤\n¤\nOur own technology is shielded against the dampeners’ effects, so activities in stutters undertaken by our Strikers and other operatives are not hindered. However, as an unfortunate side effect, the dampeners have a crippling effect on individuals who are chronon active without the aid of technology. ¤\n¤\nAccordingly, should Mr. Serene be present, you should always make him aware of your intentions before activating a dampener. You may rest assured that the dampener is not powerful enough to do actual physical harm to Mr. Serene, whose system constantly produces new chronon particles to replace the ones that are lost, but as the dampener’s effects are unpleasant and enervating, such an encounter is likely to lead to an awkward conversation about future career prospects.

Os_a3p1_160_TITLE=Presentation
Os_a3p1_170_BODY=CFR BRIEFING¤\nBy Dr. Sofia Amaral¤\n¤\nIt’s no exaggeration to say that the Chronon Field Regulator, or the CFR, is at the heart of all of Monarch’s technological advances. It has taken on a somewhat mythical quality, given its origins and the vital role it plays in the Lifeboat project, but in actuality, the CFR’s applications are very practical.¤\n¤\nThat’s not to say the CFR hasn’t had a course-altering impact on the work Monarch Solutions does. It’s been hugely influential in the development of both the stutterproofing technology that allows us to shield large areas from the effects of a zero state, enabling time to keep flowing within them even as it stops everywhere else, as well as the smaller, personalized application of the same technology: the portable chronon harnesses that allow our soldiers and technicians to operate freely within stutters.¤\n¤\nWe think of Dr. Henry Kim as the father of all this technology, and deservedly so, but for all of his brilliance, it was his dedication to uncovering the secrets of the CFR that allowed him to make his breakthroughs. Despite Dr. Kim’s hard work, the CFR’s functionality is still not fully understood, and we have not been able to replicate the device. Having more than one of them would obviously be greatly advantageous to us, but we find ourselves in a precarious position where in order to fully investigate it, we would have to take it apart. Given its immense power, such an undertaking would pose obvious risks. Perhaps even more importantly, there’s no guarantee that we would be able to put it back together again. Given that it’s vital to the implementation of the Lifeboat protocol, it’s our policy to leave it intact.¤\n¤\nWe do know, however, that the CFR can not only store an immense amount of chronon particles, it can also tap into the Meyer-Joyce field and, with great precision, manipulate it. It’s this unique ability that our own chronon technology replicates, albeit at far less control and efficiency. It’s also what makes the Lifeboat protocol a reality. By itself, our stutterproofing technology is powerful and reliable, but its rate of chronon particle consumption is high, and it increases at an alarming rate as we widen the volume of space the stutterproofing covers. This would, on the face of it, make the stutterproofing a very temporary solution indeed – one that could perhaps buy us some subjective weeks once we enter a permanent zero state, but which would ultimately only delay the inevitable.¤\n¤\nHowever, the CFR changes all of that. When the permanent stutterproofing installed on the Lifeboat – indeed, the very stutterproofing that makes the Lifeboat the Lifeboat in the first place – is directed by the CFR, the system becomes vastly more efficient. Our chronon particle consumption is reduced to around 1% of what it otherwise would be. Given that chronon particles are hard to source, even at our Ground Zero installation, and our stockpiles are decidedly limited, this means that the CFR makes the difference between Lifeboat being a temporary stopgap solution, or a very long-term undertaking that, hopefully, allows us to eventually find a solution to the End of Time.

Os_a3p1_180_BODY=People,¤\n¤\nIt seems we are having an even busier day than we anticipated. Be aware that both Liam Burke and Jack Joyce are now being held in the detention center at the island. It should go without saying that Burke no longer has any authority within Monarch Solutions, and should be treated as any other detainee. Both Burke and Joyce are considered exceptionally dangerous, and Joyce particularly so; he is chronon active, and should be handled with caution. That said, Joyce has given himself up. It’s possible that he has realized the futility of his position and the fight has simply gone out of him, but I’m not convinced he has no ulterior motive.¤\n¤\nMr. Serene has to concentrate on his speech tonight. It’s extremely important to the future of this company, so please ensure that everything goes smoothly.¤\n¤\nIn the meantime, I will personally be conducting an interrogation of Joyce. Please expect my arrival at the detention center shortly.¤\n¤\nMartin Hatch
Os_a3p1_190_BODY=People,¤\n¤\nIt appears we have been overtaken by events, and we have had to adjust our plans accordingly. As you are no doubt aware, we now have Jack Joyce in custody; he gave himself up earlier today. As Mr. Serene has a personal interest in Joyce and the information he might have, he will be interrogating him at the detention center on the island.¤\n¤\nUnfortunately, this means that Mr. Serene cannot be there for the speech he was scheduled to give at the gala event tonight, so I will have to stand in for him. I have some new security requirements pertaining to that, but I will discuss those with specific individuals in person.¤\n¤\nFurthermore, be aware that in addition to Joyce, we also have Liam Burke held at the detention center. Despite his long service to Monarch, Burke is now to be considered hostile, and has already done quite a bit of damage to us. I shouldn’t have to say this, but just to be absolutely clear: any orders given by him should be ignored.¤\n¤\nPlease ensure that Joyce is ready for Mr. Serene. Also please bear in mind that Joyce is chronon active, and extremely dangerous. He has given himself up voluntarily, so it’s entirely possible he doesn’t intend to cause trouble, but let’s make sure we’re prepared if he does. We don’t know his motivations, and I would not put it past him to use his surrender as a means to exact a hidden agenda.¤\n¤\nMartin Hatch
Os_a3p1_200_BODY=Paul Serene has become preoccupied with the appearance of Jack Joyce. He has put aside his engagements at tonight’s gala in order to focus on some feeble attempt to convert Jack to our cause. This distraction presents us with the perfect opportunity to push our agenda. Tonight we send Monarch into a state of chaos. Tonight we ensure Paul Serene’s downfall. ¤\n¤\nI have managed to convince Paul to allow me to deliver the gala speech on his behalf, creating the perfect cover. ¤\n¤\nSteps are as follows:¤\n¤\n1. GALA SHOOTING¤\nI will be delivering Paul’s speech at the gala very soon. I have arranged for an inside resource to fire shots in my direction from a vantage point halfway through the speech, narrowly missing me on stage. This will throw the gala into pandemonium and destabilize Monarch to a point where Paul’s authority and control of the situation will be called into question. More immediately, it will force Monarch to initiate security measures that will lead to Sofia Amaral being locked into the nearby Monarch villa "for her protection."¤\n¤\n2. DRONE SABOTAGE¤\nStetson will recalibrate Drone A7’s flight pattern and cause it to crash directly into the villa, killing Sofia Amaral and therefore removing Paul Serene’s only means of developing the treatments necessary for his sickness.¤\n¤\n3. TREATMENT LAB DEMOLITION¤\nIn the aftermath of Amaral’s death I will head an investigation that will allow me to gain access to Dr. Kim’s lab, where the entirety of Paul’s treatments are kept. Demolition charges will be planted and every single treatment will be destroyed. With no further treatments forthcoming, Paul will be rendered helpless.¤\n¤\nWith the stutters happening more and more often, I predict that Paul’s sickness will take hold within six hours of these events. Only then will we make our final move.

Os_a3p1_205_BODY=I’ve aided in Jack Joyce’s escape from his cell. He is here to kidnap Dr. Sofia Amaral. This presents the perfect opportunity to move forward with our agenda.

As Jack nears her location have Stetson sabotage the drone surveillance so that his movements will remain undetected. Assist Joyce’s mission in any covert manner possible.¤\n¤\nSofia is Paul’s only resource capable of developing the treatments he needs. With her out of the picture, we only need to destroy his remaining treatments to render Paul helpless as his sickness grows. All of his treatments are kept in Dr. Kim’s lab. I will gain access to the area and ensure that the entire lab is destroyed. ¤\n¤\nI predict that Paul’s sickness will take hold within six hours of these events, spurred by the increasingly frequent stutters.

Os_a3p1_250_BODY=Hey Sofia,¤\n¤\nStill haven’t got any notes back from you on the first half of my screenplay, but I’m finished the second half now so I’ll send it your way. Let me know what you think!¤\n¤\n¤\n¤\nTIME KNIFE ¤\nWritten By Bruce Livingstone¤\n¤\nACT TWO¤\n¤\nBruce has just had his best friend killed by his boss, Paul Marine. Bruce now has a time knife that sends things through time if he stabs them. He is going to Paul Marine’s wedding now to tell his girlfriend Sofine not to marry him because he’s a real shitty guy.¤\n¤\nINT. WEDDING BUILDING – DAY¤\n¤\nIt is a wedding. Paul Marine and his girlfriend SOFINE are getting married. Sofine is real attractive. If most girls are ham sandwiches then she is a 16 oz steak. ¤\n¤\nBruce enters the wedding building. ¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nStop!¤\n¤\nSOFINE:¤\nBruce! I am so happy that you came.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nYou can’t marry Paul Marine. He’s a real shitty guy.¤\n¤\nPAUL MARINE:¤\nHe’s lying.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nI’m not. He killed my best friend with time bullets.¤\n¤\nSOFINE:¤\nBut that’s impossible. Time travel doesn’t exist yet.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nThat’s what they want us to think, but I actually have a knife that is also a time machine and sends people through time when I stab them.¤\n¤\nSOFINE:¤\nI want to believe you but that doesn’t make sense. ¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nI will prove it. ¤\n¤\nBruce grabs Sofine’s mom.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nHere is a bunch of money for lottery tickets. ¤\n¤\nBruce gives Sofine’s mom a bunch of money for lottery tickets. He stabs her with the time knife, but gently not violently just so that she will travel through time. She disappears. ¤\n¤\nSofine’s mom enters the wedding building. She is now wearing different clothes.¤\n¤\nSOFINE’S MOM:¤\nHe is right. He stabbed me gently with the time knife and I was sent to the past. He also gave me a bunch of money which I used to buy a lottery ticket that I knew would win and now I have a million dollars.¤\n¤\nSOFINE:¤\nYou helped my mom become rich. Thank you Bruce.¤\n¤\nBRUCE: ¤\nYou made me rich the first moment I saw you. Rich in my heart. With love. ¤\n¤\nSOFINE:¤\nI always loved you most. But Paul Marine and I already just got married. ¤\n¤\nPAUL MARINE:¤\nYou’re too late.¤\n¤\nWEDDING MINISTER:¤\nOr is he?¤\n¤\nThe minister pulls off his mask. He is actually George Washington. ¤\n¤\nGEORGE WASHINGTON:¤\nBruce knew you were getting married so he stabbed himself and traveled to the past, then stabbed me so that I would be sent to this time. I then pretended to be a wedding minister for the ceremony, but I am actually not a minister at all which means the marriage isn’t official. ¤\n¤\nSOFINE:¤\nYou did all of this for me?¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nYes. I stabbed George Washington because I love you. Also, the man you were about to marry wasn’t actually Paul Marine.¤\n¤\nPaul Marine takes off his mask. It’s Slobbo, Bruce’s best friend.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nThis is actually a fake wedding. I saved Slobbo’s life and then had him disguise himself as your boyfriend to make this look real but it was actually a test to see if we were meant to be.¤\n¤\nSOFINE:¤\nThe only thing meant to be… is your death!¤\n¤\nSofine pulls out a gun. She pulls off her mask. It’s the real Paul Marine.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nBut how?¤\n¤\nPAUL MARINE:¤\nI followed you to the past using my time bullets and discovered your plan to marry Sofine so I already married Sofine in the past. She didn’t want to, but then I showed her this baby.¤\n¤\nPaul Marine reveals a baby. ¤\n¤\nPAUL MARINE:¤\nI told her that this baby was actually our baby from the future and that I used time bullets to travel with the baby back to the past to show her that we had a family together in the future. But in reality it is just a baby that I stole that isn’t mine.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nThen whose baby is it?¤\n¤\nThe real Sofine enters wearing futuristic pants and a shirt.¤\n¤\nSOFINE:¤\nOurs! ¤\n¤\nBRUCE: ¤\nAre you Sofine from the future?¤\n¤\nSOFINE:¤\nYes. You are very quick to understand things. I came to the past to tell you that in the future you and I got married, Bruce. We had a very active and highly satisfying sex life which led to the birth of our future child, Urugae. That is the baby that Paul Marine is holding. He stole our baby.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nBut why?¤\n¤\nSOFINE¤\nPaul Marine stole our baby and then traveled to the past so that he could use the baby as a lie to trick younger me to marry him instead by saying that it was actually the baby that he would have with me in the future. The past version of me believed him and because of that I married Paul Marine instead and no longer ever marry you at all.¤\n¤\nSLOBBO:¤\nAwwww mannnn.¤\n¤\nPAUL MARINE:¤\nIt’s over, Bruce. We’re married.¤\n¤\nBRUCE: ¤\nUntil death do you part. ¤\n¤\nBruce pulls out the time knife. Paul Marine pulls out his gun with the time bullets inside. ¤\n¤\nThey have the best fight of any movie ever. At the end Bruce has Paul Marine with a knife to his neck.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nIt’s been a… slice.¤\n¤\nBruce lifts his knife up to cut Paul Marine.¤\n¤\nPAUL MARINE:¤\nYou won’t get me this easy!¤\n¤\nPaul Marine aims the gun at himself and shoots himself thirty times. The clip is bigger than a regular pistol. ¤\n¤\nPaul disappears, but then thirty Paul Marines enter.¤\n¤\nPAUL MARINE: ¤\nI shot myself thirty times so that I was sent to many different times at the same time which meant there were thirty of me. Now we are all here to kill you. ¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nWhich means that each of you has a time bullet inside of you.¤\n¤\nPAUL MARINE:¤\nOf course but I made sure that we were all shot in areas that have no vital organs and we will get the bullets removed after we kill you.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nUnfortunately for you I traveled to the past earlier and took your gun and added an electric charge on each of your time bullets. I control the electric charges with this handheld detonator. ¤\n¤\nPAUL MARINE:¤\nNo!¤\n¤\nBRUCE: ¤\nYes. It’s quite… shocking.¤\n¤\nBruce presses his detonator. All thirty Paul Marines are electrified from the inside. Their skin peels open all over like sausages that are left on the bbq for too long that peel open all over. The Paul Marines all die.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nConsider this my resignation.¤\n¤\nURUGAE:¤\nGoo goo ga ga. ¤\n¤\nSLOBBO:¤\nAwwww yeahhhh.¤\n¤\nGEORGE WASHINGTON:¤\nGod bless America.¤\n¤\nBruce and Sofine make out. ¤\n¤\nSofine waits for a few seconds for the audience to stop applauding before saying her next line. ¤\n¤\nSOFINE:¤\nCongratulations. You passed the test.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nWhat test?¤\n¤\nSOFINE:¤\nWe always believed you were the chosen one so we traveled to the past to test you and make sure. We now believe you are ready to fight the ultimate villain from the future. ¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nOkay.¤\n¤\nSLOBBO:¤\nWho is the ultimate villain?¤\n¤\nSOFINE:¤\n His name is Paul Marine.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nBut I just killed Paul Marine.¤\n¤\nSOFINE:¤\nNo. The Paul Marine you have known this whole time has actually been an actor from the future that we paid to play Paul Marine for the test. The actual Paul Marine is exactly the same but he lives in the future.¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nHe was an actor. Which means my job was fake as well.¤\n¤\nSOFINE:¤\nYes. That is the only reason why you were kept in a low-level position for so many years without a single promotion and it appeared that people didn’t give you the respect that you clearly deserve. Because in reality you are the chosen one. ¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nIt all makes sense now. ¤\n¤\nSOFINE:¤\nWe must travel to the future. Are you ready?¤\n¤\nBRUCE:¤\nLooks like it’s TIME to find out.¤\n¤\nBruce puts on his shades.

Os_a4p1_080_BODY=ENTRY 63¤\nI just got back from the funeral. My parents are dead. It feels like I was just told about the crash an hour ago. It isn’t real yet. Standing there I was numb to it all. Weighed down under some expectation to emote in a manner that suited the situation. As if I needed to cry to appease the crowd. ¤\nJack was always the younger brother copying me. In that graveyard our roles were strangely reversed. Tears were running down my brother’s face and I was observing him like some alien desperately trying to learn to feel. Looking at the pain in his eyes, I wasn’t thinking about my parents at all. Only Jack. Death is supposed to bring the living closer together but I’ve never felt more distant from somebody I cared for so dearly. ¤\nIt tears me up inside that I can’t protect him from what he’s going through. I can’t ease his pain. I don’t have the social proficiency to wield my empathy into some well-articulated apology that will make him forget this. The irony is that the only cure for his pain is time.¤\nTime. Ever since February 28th, 1999, the concept has been given new meaning. The experiment was meant to give hope, not take it away. What I was told that day has haunted me ever since. The very notion of a Fracture in time has overshadowed everything since. Even this. ¤\nI don’t need to see the future to know that I will let him down. I can’t be the parental figure that Jack has lost. I can’t be the brother that he needs. It's Christmas – I can't even give him that. No one can. There’s nothing I want more than to protect him. And there’s only one way I know how to do that with certainty. ¤\nI will finish the countermeasure. I will make sure that the dangers I was warned of that day never come to pass. ¤\nI can’t fix the past. But it’s not too late for the future.

Os_a4p1_110_BODY=MEMO: CONTROLLING THE RIVERPORT SITUATION¤\nFROM: Clarice Ogawa¤\nTO: Field Team Leads¤\n¤\nI know the situation is fluid and things are progressing fast, but I want to reiterate our strategy for maintaining control over the city of Riverport.¤\n¤\nAs you all know, we can’t actually directly control the city. We don’t have the manpower, and we don’t have the actual authority. It’s therefore vital that we maintain a good relationship with the media and the local authorities, and have them do much of the heavy lifting for us. Ideally, everything we do should be either undertaken by the authorities under our discreet direction, or in cases where we take action ourselves, backed by the powers that be, creating the illusion that Monarch Solutions is working in cooperation with legal authorities.¤\n¤\nMake no mistake: although we’ve been successful thus far, the situation is not stable, and it can change quickly. If key parties in the city lose confidence in us and our ability to handle the crisis, our control will erode very quickly. Therefore, we must nurture this relationship even as we conduct our own operations, some of which involve considerable troop mobilization and combat action. This is a constant balancing act, and while I’m confident we can pull it off, there’s no room for error. We can’t afford to grow complacent and sloppy.¤\n¤\nFortunately, we are well-prepared for this contingency. Long before we reached this point, we established a good rapport with the Mayor, Riverport PD and other major authorities within Riverport, as well as most of the important media outlets. Our strategy is twofold:¤\n¤\n1. MAINTAIN CONTROL.  It’s imperative that we ensure that the city’s various power structures remain under our control. This means maintaining a close relationship with numerous individuals and organizations, as well as manipulating the information at their disposal. While Charlie Wincott is unfortunately no longer working on this project due to unforeseen complications, he has set up powerful tools and procedures for scrubbing the internet and identifying and locating problematic situations and individuals. We’re stationing people in key locations and maintaining control, often under the guise of “advisors” and “consultants” to people in power. They are ready to step in as required. Anybody working in these roles needs to be proactive and project a constant aura of helpful authority and dependability. Diplomacy is the order of the day, people; that’s vital for maintaining certain fictions, such as Jack Joyce’s culpability in the events at the university, etc.¤\n¤\n2. MINIMIZE CONFLICT. That is to say, make sure that individuals – whether they’re politicians, city officials, police officers, reporters, ordinary citizens, etc. – suffer a minimal impact from our activities. If we have to use force, the situation needs to take place out of sight and remain entirely contained. Whether containment means misdirection, coercion, intimidation, bribery or some other means depends on the circumstances, but it’s vital that nobody is left in a position to complain. To be explicitly clear: this doesn’t mean we can eliminate witnesses and cover it up. When people don’t come home, others start to ask questions, so that has to be a last resort. I expect all supervisors to monitor their teams closely to ensure things stay on an even keel. I know most of our operatives haven’t been trained in the soft touch, and I’ll be blunt: the last thing we need is somebody thinking this is Afghanistan and smacking a civilian around. We’re one YouTube video away from this whole thing blowing up in our faces, so we have to maintain our operational profile throughout.¤\n¤\nFor all of these activities, we have a considerable budget. Monarch Solutions is very well off, we’ve been building resources for a long time, and this is considered a priority. So we can buy a lot of silence and cooperation from authorities and citizens alike. But that only works as long as those things are for sale – and the moment we’re seen as a threat, that opportunity will disappear.¤\n¤\nIf you see a problem, be proactive, and CALL IT IN. Don’t let anything run out of control or think it’ll work itself out. We have to be sure. The situation can unravel faster than we think, and we have to coordinate our activities properly. Any questions or concerns, please contact me sooner rather than later.

Os_a4p1_132_BODY=MONARCH SOLUTIONS¤\nMission Statement¤\nBy Paul Serene¤\nDecember 12, 1999¤\n¤\n[LIMITED DISTRIBUTION! For approved employees only.]¤\n¤\nI have seen the path ahead, and I know it will be hard. I have founded Monarch Solutions to bring together those who will walk it with me – the elite few whose skill, dedication and passion will live on when everything else ends.¤\n¤\nTo that end, ¤\n¤\n1. We will work under my guiding vision of the future – my knowledge of what is coming. We accept that we cannot change our fate, nor can we avoid it. It is a harsh truth – but it is the truth. We will accept it and its full implications, but we will not deviate from our course, nor give in to despair, nor give up the fight.  Those of us who share in this knowledge, who learn the triumphs and tragedies of the days and years to come, will look past them, and find ways to turn them to our advantage. The gray, uncertain area beyond what is known will be where we build our empire, and we build it on the hope that we can persevere – that the end isn’t our end, that we can still succeed.¤\n¤\n2. We will expand Monarch’s influence and power in all possible spheres – financial, political, cultural, medical, technological, military – to the best of our ability. This is a goal unto itself. We will need to be in a position of exceptional resources and ability to act when the time comes. We will build. We will seek success and profit, not for the sake of wealth and fame, but for the sake of preparedness.¤\n¤\n3. We will develop science and technology to counter a very specific set of circumstances. This will require extensive research and experimentation, as well as a tremendous financial cost. We will not be daunted by these challenges. We will complete our work.¤\n¤\n4. We will not compromise. We recognize that sacrifice is required, and we are willing to pay the cost to meet our goals. There is no alternative to this. Doubt, qualms and sentiment are luxuries we cannot afford. Whatever we have to do is a lesser evil than the extinction of the entire human race, and to pretend otherwise is weakness. Nothing in the history of our planet has been as important as this. Nothing we have accomplished as a species matters if we fail in our mission.¤\n¤\n5. We will not fail.¤\n¤\nThere will be many challenges in the years ahead. I know what’s coming. It can’t be averted. There’s no escaping it. But we can survive it, and we can overcome it. And we will. I am dedicating myself, this company, and every shred of willpower at my disposal to that mission.¤\n¤\nI expect the same from those who join me on it.¤\n¤\nPaul Serene

Os_a4p1_133_BODY=ON THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THE LIFEBOAT¤\nBy Dr. Sofia Amaral¤\nAugust 18, 2016¤\n¤\nWhile the Lifeboat Protocol is fairly straightforward on the surface, it’s important that the people involved with the project understand how it radically differs from other survival scenarios against so-called apocalyptic threats.¤\n¤\nStutterproofing¤\n¤\nA traditional bunker built to protect the occupants from an environmental hazard (e.g., a chemical attack or nuclear fallout) is typically sealed airtight, and the occupants have their own electricity, air supply, provisions, etc. The bunker’s interior is isolated from the outside environment. But the Lifeboat’s design is different. It’s not actually sealed, because it doesn’t have to be; it does have strong walls and protected access points, but the outside environment is not the problem – it’s the lack of the Meyer-Joyce field that enables time to exist that makes the outside hazardous. From a technological standpoint, these differences make the Lifeboat’s operating principles quite different, particularly with regards to maintenance.¤\n¤\nCompared to, say, the failure of the life support system in a hermetically sealed survival space, such as a bunker, the failure of the Lifeboat’s stutterproofing system has far more immediate and grave effects. A traditional life support system can be repaired – for instance, a failure in the CO2 scrubbers would pose a significant threat, but with replacement parts and tools, properly trained occupants could easily repair the system before they would feel any ill effects. In fact, almost any mechanical failure short of a full-scale environmental breach can be fixed as long as suitable repair materials and trained personnel are at hand.¤\n¤\nBut by its very nature, the stutterproofing is different: if it fails, everybody within its area of effect is immediately affected by the zero state, and becomes frozen. In a permanent zero state scenario, that means they would have no opportunity to ever effect repairs; there’s literally no time to react. The only exception would be personnel wearing an activated chronon harness, such as the Striker suit, but given that repairing the stutterproofing system is a highly technical, complicated process requiring an exceptional proficiency in the operation and engineering of chronon technology, this would be a scenario with a low probability of success.¤\n¤\nIt is therefore of utmost importance that the Lifeboat’s stutterproofing operates reliably and without faults, with multiple failsafe systems, because if it ever fails, it’s unlikely that it can be repaired or restarted. Accordingly, once the Lifeboat Protocol has been activated, there’s no real way to deactivate it other than removing the Chronon Field Regulator. This would be highly inadvisable, as doing so could not only disrupt the stutterproofing, but more importantly, without the CFR, the Lifeboat’s rate of chronon particle consumption is increased by a vast margin, effectively reducing its potential operating time to a fraction of what is intended.¤\n¤\nUnique advantages and risks¤\n¤\nHowever, it’s worth pointing out that even though the Lifeboat operation has unique hazards, there are also unique advantages. One such advantage is provisions. A traditional survival scenario in a bunker typically involves a poor quality of meals, due to obvious resourcing problems – anything that spoils easily is out of the question.¤\n¤\nIn a zero state scenario, however, spoilage becomes a non-issue. Anything stored outside the stutterproofed area remains in perfect condition. This advantage doesn’t only apply to comestibles, but also makes the storage of medicine, volatile chemicals and other similar articles far less of a problem than it otherwise would be. In fact, given the fact that the city of Riverport is vast compared to the relatively small number of people residing in the Lifeboat, in theory Monarch operatives could venture outside the Lifeboat in chronon harnesses and actually enjoy freshly cooked meals simply by entering a restaurant and finding the ready-made dishes that have been prepared, remove them from the zero state to a stutterproofed area, and enjoy them, as hot and delicious as if they had been just prepared – which, in fact, they of course would be.¤\n¤\nTo be clear: this is not a recommended activity, as it would be a foolish waste of resources to go after individual meals like that. The above scenario is mentioned here merely to illustrate the point; even though the Lifeboat has been designed to operate for decades of subjective time, it doesn’t actually need provisions for that long. If the Lifeboat’s own reserves start to run low, a well-planned supply run into the city could easily result in a great deal of perfectly preserved supplies.¤\n¤\nAnother advantage is that while the situation outside the Lifeboat would be dire, people frozen in the zero state would not actually be dead. If a solution is found to the End of Time scenario, everybody would resume their everyday lives, most likely with no awareness of time ever having stopped. However, it’s hard to know what the exact psychological impact of that knowledge on Lifeboat personnel will be.¤\n¤\nThere’s a real concern that the pressure of knowing that they have sole responsibility for the survival of the human race, and that there are billions of people outside of the walls of the Lifeboat, helpless and unaware, frozen eternally in that last moment, may prove to be crushing for some. On the other hand, knowing that their loved ones are actually not dead, and may be saved, and are not in any distress, or indeed even aware of the situation may prove to be a powerful motivating factor that helps us eventually resolve the situation. Of course, the solution to the problem of a permanent zero state is not currently within our reach, and we expect that finding one will take subjective decades, if it is indeed possible. We can but try.¤\n¤\nIt’s worth noting that since the people outside Lifeboat are indeed not dead, merely stopped, it should be possible for a team of personnel wearing chronon harnesses to exit the Lifeboat, retrieve a person, and bring them into the Lifeboat. However, I advise against adopting this practice; for the occupants, that should forever remain a theoretical scenario. Any situation in which somebody is brought in from the outside would cause undue stress on the occupants, who would at that point have to become acutely aware that their loved ones could be brought in… but since the Lifeboat has limited space, this could never be allowed. That kind of psychological pressure would likely lead to friction and questions of favoritism and, ultimately, increase the risk mission failure.

DO NOT APPROACH SHIFTERS ALONE. Remember that they are not restricted by the physical space in the same way we are. Deploy dampeners and watch your backs. Work in teams, remember your tactics, MAINTAIN YOUR DISTANCE. Don’t take any unnecessary chances.¤\n¤\nComms are unreliable due to the stutters, so pass the word to others, and take advantage of stutter collapses to communicate as effectively as you can. We are attempting to repair the stutterproofing as quickly as possible, but be advised that contrary to our earlier timeline, which gave us years more to prepare, we believe we are now on the verge of the final zero state, and every single stutter we encounter is more and more likely to be the one that never ends. That means our priorities have changed: the Lifeboat Protocol is in full effect, and ensuring its success is our only objective, whether the opposition is shifters, Jack Joyce, or anybody else.¤\n¤\nIt’s vital that we all remember our training – if we do things right, we WILL make it out of this, and we WILL make our way into the Lifeboat.¤\n¤\nGood luck, and make me proud.

I had maintenance access, and I used it. But I want you to know I did it under tremendous duress: Martin Hatch left me no choice. He threatened my family, and I didn’t know what else to do. ¤\n¤\nI still don’t. I know there are Shifters out there. The stutterproofing is gone, and I don’t have a chronon harness, so technically, I’m safe. The Shifters only exist in stutters, and when one of those hits, I freeze, just like the rest of the world. So whatever happens during the stutter, I’m safe, barring some kind of a desynchronization-related accident.¤\n¤\nWhat that means, though, is that one eyeblink I’m here, and the next one there’s two dead Strikers on the floor. Dead because of me. Their blood all over me, from nowhere. I’m looking at them right now, typing this on my phone. I can smell the blood and… I don’t know, ozone? I guess? And smoke. Their gear’s sparking. They’d be alive if I hadn’t¤\n¤\nI’m sorry. I think I’m hyperventilating. I don’t know if I can hold it together much longer. I don’t know why Hatch wanted this to happen, but he did. I think he wants the CFR for some reason? You can’t trust that fucker, sir. I know you’re close, but I think he’s as evil as they come. ¤\n¤\nI’m so sorry, sir. I’m not making excuses. I know I fucked up.¤\n¤\nI don’t know how to deal with this.

Os_a6p1_130_BODY=REFLECTIONS ON THE END¤\n¤\nI wish my memories about the End of Time were clearer, but it was anything but a clear time in my life – and the world was such a jumble, a frozen mess of different timelines crashing together. I was running for my life the whole time, trying to avoid the Shifters. Not an ideal state of mind for gathering intel.¤\n¤\nAnd it didn’t help that she kept chasing me, trying to kill me. Beth Wilder. One of my own people. It was her all along. Even then, trapped in the End of Time, as little as I understood about what was going on, I could tell she wasn’t like me – that she didn’t have the powers I did. I knew she had some kind of technology that kept her going in that suspended hell.¤\n¤\nOf course, I had no idea it was a device I would eventually have my people develop. I suppose I should appreciate the irony that it was her chronon harness – my own chronon harness – that it gave me the idea for the Lifeboat protocol. The idea that our technology could let humanity survive the End of Time. I suppose I have to thank her for that. And she paid for her sins, in the end… but she left her mark on me. I know the time to pay for mine is approaching quickly. But not just yet.¤\n¤\nBack then, when Wilder and I played our game of cat and mouse at the End of Time, if I’d had an ounce of the control over my powers that I do now, things would have turned out very differently between the two of us. She was strong and had the training, and I was young and weak and scared. Even so, my abilities gave me an edge. I was lucky she didn’t have the full Striker gear.¤\n¤\nShe was the one with the upper hand. I didn’t learn to learn to properly control my abilities until much later. In those days, they were unpredictable and operated on instinct. Control didn’t come easy. I can’t help but be aware that this doesn’t seem to be the case for Jack. His mastery is growing by leaps and bounds. Is it just because that’s the way he’s always been? Fast on his feet. Bold and adaptive. Or is the Fracture affecting him, too?¤\n¤\nI thought we could contain him. It’s cost us dearly.¤\n¤\nIt’s not a mistake I will make again.

Os_a6p1_138_SUBJECT=Untitled Note
Os_a6p1_140_BODY=Clarice,¤\n¤\nAs you know, I have a mission to embark on, so I’ll try to be brief.¤\n¤\nI have initiated the Lifeboat Protocol over Martin’s objections; given how things have developed since then, I’m glad I did. I don’t fully understand Martin’s motives, but it’s obvious he’s moving against me, and against the entire survival plan itself. I know you have worked closely with him, and I know that this must come as a shock.¤\n¤\nIt’s also alarming that in evading capture, Martin took out an entire security team. For an unarmed man who’s ostensibly not combat trained, that should be impossible. Obviously, this is highly alarming news. I don’t know if he had help, or if there’s even more to Martin than we have come to suspect, but he’s had free rein over this company for a long time, and he’s extremely resourceful – and persuasive. It’s not clear to me who I can trust at this point. ¤\n¤\nBut I know I can depend on you. I trust that you will see things through in my absence and ensure the stutterproofing stays up. In particular, I would appreciate if you would ensure that Dr. Amaral stays safe in the Lifeboat. She has been through a lot during the past 24 hours, and she’s still managed to make her way back to us and bring vital intel.¤\n¤\nThank you for your loyal service, Clarice. It has always been appreciated.¤\n¤\nPaul
Os_a6p1_150_BODY=Clarice,¤\n¤\nI only have a few minutes before the chopper takes off, so this will be brief.¤\n¤\nAs you know, the Lifeboat Protocol has been initiated without my permission. I won’t pretend that Dr. Amaral’s betrayal of everything this company stands for hasn’t been a blow. At least she will no longer be a threat to our plans. I wish it hadn’t come to that, but it is what it is.¤\n¤\nRegardless, now that the Lifeboat Protocol is active, the decision has been made for us, and we’re now committed to that course. I trust you and Martin to keep an eye on everything while I’m gone. Please ensure that the protocol is executed properly and without mistakes.¤\n¤\nIt’s no exaggeration to say that the fate of humanity depends on us now, and much as I had hoped to guide us through these moments, I have to face facts: with my treatments gone, it’s questionable how long I can go on. There are still some things I must take care of, and while I believe I have enough time for that, this may be the last time we have a chance to communicate.¤\n¤\nI have always appreciated your loyal service, Clarice. It has been a pleasure and a privilege.¤\n¤\nPaul
Os_a6p1_160_BODY=Clarice, I want you to figure out where the fuck Martin Hatch is and kill him. I’d hunt him down myself but I don’t have the time for it, I need to be in that chopper in a few minutes. So make no mistake: he needs to die. There can be no doubt, don’t take any chances. CUT OFF HIS FUCKING HEAD. I sent a full security team after him, and now they’re all dead. How the hell does Martin do that? Who’s helping him? Or did he do it himself? WHAT IS HE?¤\n¤\nAt least the Lifeboat’s running. Make sure it stays that way, Clarice. That’s what this is all about and if it was for nothing, there’ll be hell to pay. And look after Sofia. I’m trusting you to not betray me. You’re not like all these gutless weasels. I see the looks they give me. Don’t think I don’t. I’m starting to see very clearly now that I’ve been too trusting for years now.¤\n¤\nI mean it, Clarice. Find that son of a bitch and kill him. Keep Lifeboat running. Take care of Sofia. Don’t let me down. I’m not going to take another betrayal well, and even though Martin destroyed my treatments, I’ve got enough time left to set things straight if I have to. Count on it.¤\n¤\nJust do it.¤\n¤\nPaul
Os_a6p1_175_BODY=Paul,¤\n¤\nDon’t worry about it, we’re on schedule. Your time machine core from the university has been transported to the HQ, and it’s currently being installed into the new time machine frame we’ve built for it. You’ll have direct access to it from the CFR chamber, as requested. (And no, before you ask, you can’t actually access the CFR chamber from the time machine. That elevator can only be activated from within the chamber – so no one working on the machine can get to the CFR. I thought you’d appreciate that layer of added security; I know how important it is to keep the CFR safe!)¤\n¤\nAnyway, I know you don’t actually intend to use the time machine, but should you ever need it, all we need to do is deploy the corridor. It’s actually all hooked up now, but we’re still running some final diagnostics. The techs should be ready with it before the gala’s over.¤\n¤\nDr. Sofia Amaral¤\nHead of Research¤\n¤\n--------------------------------------- ¤\n¤\nTO: SOFIA AMARAL¤\nFROM: PAUL SERENE¤\nDATE: OCT 9, 2016 – 2:11pm¤\nSUBJECT: Re: Time machine core¤\n¤\nSofia,¤\n¤\nPlease update me on our progress with the time machine core relocation.

I’m sorry; I didn’t mean to add to your burden, and I know that these are hard decisions. You can count on us to proceed as planned.¤\n¤\nI know you’re exceptionally busy now that the time is almost upon us, but I was hoping you’d have time for dinner?¤\n¤\nDr. Sofia Amaral¤\nHead of Research¤\n¤\n--------------------------------------- ¤\n¤\nTO: SOFIA AMARAL¤\nFROM: PAUL SERENE¤\nDATE: OCT 8, 2016 – 2:29pm¤\nSUBJECT: Re: Time machine core¤\n¤\nSofia,¤\n¤\nI understand why you would feel that way, but this isn’t something I take lightly. It’s my experience that time travel only complicates things, and while my own trip through time has given us great opportunities, it’s also set me on this path. I want to control it, not use it.¤\n¤\nThat said, I want to have the machine ready to use for emergencies. My foreknowledge of future events will end very soon, and it might prove to be useful to have the option of obtaining more detailed information from the future. (Obviously, given that the furthest you could go back is the machine’s activation at the university, visiting the past seems fairly useless.) ¤\n¤\nAlso, ensure that the machine is heavily guarded at all times. Nobody is allowed to operate the machine besides myself, and I want the corridor to remain undeployed unless I give specific orders to the contrary.¤\n¤\nAs for the Joyce brothers…¤\n¤\nI intend to give William the option of joining us, if possible, but I know him. He’s a very stubborn and unstable man, and I don’t know if we could ever trust him. I don’t need to remind you that he built, in that ridiculous little workshop, with very limited resources, a device that broke the local physics at Ground Zero, and caused my Chronon Syndrome. I don’t intend to give him a chance to show us what else he could do if he decides that we’re a target. That, along with the visions I have seen… there are certain sentimental reasons that make me wish I could let William live, but I doubt that he makes it possible for us.¤\n¤\nAs for Jack, I’m not too worried about him. It took me a long time to master my abilities, so Jack shouldn’t be a major problem unless he manages to use stutters to escape the area – luckily, stutters should be very rare in these early stages of the Fracture. Still, I’ve come too far to take any chances. I’d prefer to take him alive, but nothing can be allowed to put our plan at risk.¤\n¤\nI’m sorry to have to involve you in something like this; I know it’s not what you signed up for, and as I said, I don’t expect you to be personally involved with that part of the operation in any way. I’m not particularly happy about this part myself, and I wish I had better options. But our circumstances are as they are, and I have come too far to falter now. I hope you understand.¤\n¤\n--------------------------------------- ¤\n¤\nTO: PAUL SERENE¤\nFROM: SOFIA AMARAL¤\nDATE: OCT 7, 2016 – 1:01pm¤\nSUBJECT: Time machine core¤\n¤\nPaul,¤\n¤\nWe now have finalized the plans for acquiring and transporting the time machine core from the university lab. Your instructions are quite clear: we won’t actually move in until your younger self has entered the machine, and the men will try to take the Joyces alive, with the understanding that Jack Joyce in particular could be a threat, and neither can be allowed to escape under any circumstances. ¤\n¤\nI’m still quite uncomfortable with all this, Paul. I understand your reasoning, and I know the stakes are high, but I don’t want to see anybody hurt. It’s antithetical to my role as a scientist, and I wish you’d reconsider. Surely there’s a better way to resolve this; moral implications aside, the loss of Dr. Joyce’s expertise alone would be a great blow.¤\n¤\nIf everything goes smoothly and quietly, we will transport the core directly to the Monarch tower via ground route; if there’s commotion and it seems there’s any risk of detection, we will instead airlift the core to our drydocks operation, and then move it discreetly from there to the HQ.¤\n¤\nThe construction of the new time machine frame at the top of the Monarch tower has been finished since last year. Once we have received the core, it will be installed into the time machine, per your orders. I know you don’t intend to use it, but even with the limitations the nature of time travel imposes on us, I have to say it seems like a great waste to not take advantage of such a resource, both from a strategic and a scientific point of view.¤\n¤\nDr. Sofia Amaral¤\nHead of Research
Os_a6p1_180_BODY=PERSONAL NOTES¤\nDr. Sofia Amaral¤\nOctober 9th, 2016, 2:31pm¤\n¤\nI find myself at a loss.¤\n¤\nWe knew that the Fracture would arrive. It was clear very quickly that the process was occurring much faster than Paul’s projections – his experiences – had led us to believe. That was alarming in itself, but there’s another concern: with the Fracture, Paul’s condition seems to be accelerating rapidly. I don’t know what to do about either one of these issues.¤\n¤\nI haven’t had a chance to examine Paul properly, and of course he won’t consent to any real tests at this point. He won’t take the time, not with the situation being as critical as it is. He has to prepare for the gala. To take care of every little stupid thing Martin trots out for him. He won’t think of himself at all, and I’m afraid that’ll cost us dearly.¤\n¤\nSo I don’t know, I’m just speculating, but I believe this acceleration is a reaction to the stutters in time; in zero state, his wave function is further disrupted by the excessive chronon energies within his body. Before the university incident, before the Fracture, the condition was progressive, but controllable. The lack of stutters helped keep it in check. Now, it’s progress is rampant, and I worry that it may reach a critical point soon. We always knew that was a possibility, but all of our projections assumed we would have years – time enough to come up with a cure. Or a way to stop its progress.¤\n¤\nWhich means there’s a very real chance that in the near future, Paul’s condition overtakes him. And if he does become a Shifter, I don’t know what to do about it. We haven’t been able to help Dr. Kim; I don’t know what we could do for Paul.¤\n¤\nI don’t know what to do. The treatments are still working, but they take a toll on him, and their effect is greatly diminished. I’m concerned we may hit a point where he’s forced to use them so often that the treatment becomes worse than the condition itself. And yet, I don’t see any other options. He will not rest. He insists on doing so much. I know he chafes under his dependence on the treatments. He sees it as a weakness.¤\n¤\nI’m afraid I may lose him.
Os_a6p1_180_SUBJECT=Sofia's Personal Notes
Os_a6p1_185_BODY=Everyone,¤\n¤\nPlease be advised that we are now at a point where Lifeboat activation may occur. Accordingly, I have ensured that preparations are underway for activation. As a part of that, what chronon particle stores still remain at the Ground Zero harvesting operation are being moved to the headquarters and placed into the master chronon particle repository, ready to be placed under the CFR’s control.¤\n¤\nPlease be aware that what we have managed to accumulate until this point is very likely to be all the chronon particles we ever have access to. Due to the Fracture’s effects on the Meyer-Joyce field, the Ground Zero anomaly is showing definite signs of weakening. As a result, the chronon particle yield decreases drastically, and will soon drop to baseline. While we will obviously continue more traditional chronon particle harvesting operations in order to maximize our stockpile, we all need to recognize that sourcing them outside of the Ground Zero conditions is extremely inefficient. Or, in plain terms: unless we find another source of chronon particles – and I don’t believe we will – what we have now is all we will ever have.¤\n¤\nPlease be aware that all use of chronon technology eats into our limited resources, and while we of course recognize that we need to have our Strikers and other soldiers operate in stutters, each operation undertaken will eat away at our stockpile, and, in very real terms, cost us days of Lifeboat runtime. Accordingly, we have to plan all use of this technology closely and choose our battles carefully.¤\n¤\nThat said, we should also realize the ongoing situation with Jack Joyce constitutes an emergency, and will most likely require unconventional chronon particle investments. Just the same, we should be aware of the cost.¤\n¤\nI expect to see projected chronon particle consumption rates for the foreseeable future and simulations of how long our stockpile will last, adjusted for all of the scenarios we have discussed (see our last meeting minutes), in our next Monday Meeting.¤\n¤\nSofia Amaral¤\nHead of Research

Os_a6p1_186_BODY=People,¤\n¤\nBecause there seems to be a certain lack of clarity about when it’s appropriate for someone to enter the CFR Chamber and mess with the Chronon Field Regulator, and because I just had to fire Kevin Janeway because he did that exact thing, let me remind you of the approved CFR procedure:¤\n¤\nYOU DO NOT TOUCH THE CFR.¤\n¤\nPERIOD.¤\n¤\nI may touch the CFR, because I’m the lead technician in charge of it. Dr. Sofia Amaral may touch the CFR, because she’s our head of research and she knows what she’s doing. Mr. Paul Serene may touch the CFR, because he’s Paul fucking Serene, and it’s his CFR.¤\n¤\nNOBODY ELSE TOUCHES THE CFR.¤\n¤\nOn occasion, some enormously lucky individuals who have been personally trained by me and are proven to be very, very dependable and incredibly good at their jobs, who don’t have a track record of trying to enter the CFR chamber like paint-huffing imbeciles because “they just wanted to take a closer look at it,” and who have remembered to bribe the lead technician in charge of the CFR with Tom Waits tickets, may be given written instructions to perform specific procedures on the CFR. That will be a great honor and a sign of a significant degree of trust, and those people should be accorded all professional respect and an appropriate degree of brownnosing and/or passive-aggressive displays of envy by their peers.¤\n¤\nOr, to put it another way, YOU DO NOT TOUCH THE CFR unless you want to join Kevin in the “how to stop being an arrogant dumb shit who jeopardized the only hope of a future for the entire human race because his mansplaining ass thought what the CFR really needed was a random dude Who Knew Better” self-improvement course down at the unemployment office, which I’m sure is where we all believe he was escorted to by those armed men.¤\n¤\nThere are no exceptions to this. The entire Lifeboat Protocol depends on the CFR being present, properly connected and functioning normally. You do not want to jeopardize this. This is bigger than any of us, and we are not here to fuck around.¤\n¤\nLauren McStevenson¤\nLead CFR tech

Os_a6p1_215_BODY=PERSONAL NOTES ON THE CFR¤\nJanuary 5, 2011¤\nDr. Henry Kim¤\n¤\nThis thing feels like a conundrum wrapped in a puzzle. It’s an incredible piece of technology, and I feel like we’re only scratching the surface of what it can do – and we have already learned so much. I thought I had a good understanding of the intricacies of chronon particles and their practical applications before. Now I realize that I’ve still got a great deal to learn.¤\n¤\nThe Chronon Field Regulator, as I’ve decided to call it, is a little miracle. How such a small device can do so much is beyond me. I know it taps into the Meyer-Joyce field, but I don’t know how; my experiments just show it can do it. It can also manipulate the field. I wish I knew how. Still, the mechanics of its operation give me ideas – new avenues of thought I’ve been trying to find for such a long time.¤\n¤\nThe task that I’ve been set by Mr. Serene has, frankly, stumped me for years. Knowing that what we observe as the passage of time is just the result of chronon particles being constantly generated within the Meyer-Joyce field is a simple fact that I’ve been aware of for a long time. But being able to manipulate those particles in a meaningful way – well, that’s another question.¤\n¤\nThe mechanics of the situation are clear, almost frustratingly so. In a zero state environment, there are no chronon particles, and thus time is frozen. The idea of artificially flooding an area with chronon particles to enable the passage of time is the obvious solution. But actually finding a way of doing that… that’s something else. Not only are chronon particles incredibly difficult to source, so obtaining enough to actually “stutterproof” an area for any time longer than a fraction of a second has always seemed impossible. Perhaps even more importantly, the mechanism of manipulating the particles in a way that would actually allow me to define a certain volume of space as “stutterproofed” has constantly eluded me.¤\n¤\nWell, Ground Zero has solved the former problem for us: we’re almost up and running, and very soon we will have the ability to harvest chronon particles at useful rates. We’ll be able to build a truly formidable stockpile of them in the years to come. As for the latter problem, manipulating the chronon particles  – that seems to be something the CFR does with ease. Its ability to tap into the Meyer-Joyce field and effect changes in its topology is exactly what I need.¤\n¤\nUnfortunately, I don’t know how it does it. I don’t have a clue. And I don’t know how to effectively control these effects. But my research into the practical effects of its operation has given me ideas for a different kind of chronon technology that works on a somewhat similar principle – except instead of tapping into the Meyer-Joyce field, it generates a similar, localized field of its own – an artificial chronon particle field. And within that field, we can manipulate chronon particles at will. This means that we should be able to create “stutterproofing” technology, allowing us to shield a certain area from the effects of zero state, and I believe I will be able to miniaturize the technology to allow for personalized devices with the same effect – almost like an environmental suit of sorts, with a harness the user would wear to create a chronon field around his body.¤\n¤\nThere are still many challenges here, one of which is that the any significant volume of stutterproofed space will incur an unacceptably high drain on chronon particles, which are a decidedly limited resource. Obviously, with the Lifeboat Protocol requiring a large stutterproofed area that we can maintain for years, quite possibly decades, this is a critical issue we have to solve, and Mr. Serene has made that quite clear to me. Frankly, even with Mr. Hatch backing me, the thought of disappointing Serene over this makes me quite anxious. I understand his concerns, and they are of course entirely founded, but the man’s intensity is unnerving.¤\n¤\nIn any case, I’m hopeful that I will figure out this problem soon. I’m hoping to be able to use the CFR itself to regulate the flow of chronon particles; given its nature, I suspect it might be eminently suitable for such a role in the Lifeboat project and cut down our chronon consumption rate by a great margin. My control over the CFR is limited, but this seems to be a very basic functionality for it, so I’m optimistic that I can do it.¤\n¤\nI’m still looking into it. One thing at a time; we’ve already made great progress, and I will say that Mr. Serene’s been quite complimentary with these successes, so I think he’ll give us the time we need. (Well, it’s not like he has a lot of choice in the matter.)¤\n¤\nI’ll be honest: the CFR is becoming a bit of an obsession for me. I wish I could sit down and have that conversation and just ask those questions: how did he build it? What it’s actually for? But I’ve been denied that opportunity. A part of me wants to open the CFR up and get to the bottom of it – but the potential consequences terrify me; we’ve already seen what it can do if unleashed. Even worse, there’s the possibility that I couldn’t put it back together, and just the idea of making a mistake like that is a positively bowel-liquefying thought. Having to explain that to Mr. Serene… No, thank you.¤\n¤\nSo, as it is, I have only dared to open up a bit of the casing to get a rough idea of some of the engineering inside. It’s amazing work, and it has certainly been a lesson in humility for me. I still have a lot to learn – but I’m a very fast learner, and this has to be the most important work anyone has ever engaged in in the history of humanity. If we succeed in our mission, the world will not soon forget the name of Dr. Henry Kim.

Os_a6p1_230_BODY=Paul, Martin,¤\n¤\nI know you’ve both been arguing that the Quantum Ripple Causality Research Subdivision has great potential, and we should keep it funded. I must once again implore you to reconsider.¤\n¤\nI’ll be the first one to admit that the technology is impressive. The fact that Drs. Morfin and Rangers can actually track the consequences rippling out from minor shifts within the Meyer-Joyce field is incredible, and the level of informational detail they manage to obtain is amazing. But here’s the thing: they’ve been at this for two years now, and they have not produced a single useful result.¤\n¤\nYes, we can trace actual events from their small inception point to the actual consequences, very much in keeping with the basic chaos theory concept of the butterfly flapping its wings, but, well – so what? Every single thing that happens in this universe is the result of such a chain of events. Being able to see the chain offers no real insight to anything due to the very randomness of the process. Furthermore, it’s utterly misleading – you could say that some tiny event or tiny decision in my life yesterday led me to writing this e-mail, and that’s technically true, but so did some tiny event or tiny decision in my life fifteen years ago – it’s all a chain; the event yesterday didn’t take place in a vacuum. It didn’t come out of nowhere. So what’s the point? We have no control over it, we don’t get to direct it, and we get no useful information out of it.¤\n¤\nAlso, have you actually seen the reports they generate? From a technological point of view, the way they manage to automate their analysis of the fluctuation signatures within the Meyer-Joyce field is impressive, but again, it’s all meaningless babble with no practical applications. Their personal remarks on the reports are even worse. With all due respect to Ron and Terry and their indisputable technical expertise, I don’t know what they’re doing, and I’m not sure they do, either. It’s like they’re coming up with stuff at random.¤\n¤\nThe above outlines my concerns as to the futility of the entire process, and I suspect that may not be enough to sway you – but I have one final point, which I think you should consider very, very carefully.¤\n¤\nThe entire program is an unforgivable waste of Monarch resources. I don’t mean money, although the entire Quantum Ripple Causality Reserach Subdivision is costing us millions and millions of dollars – but that doesn’t really matter, because I know we can afford that. However, there’s a more vital resource they’re consuming; each time they fire up their rig and delve into the Meyer-Joyce field, they eat up a huge amount of chronon particles. Those are a finite resource, and as you know, we are projecting that the Ground Zero’s yield will rapidly diminish as the Fracture takes hold – which will happen very soon. You may not understand what the real impact of this is, so let me put it to you in practical terms: every single time they detect and analyze a quantum ripple, it costs us a week of potential Lifeboat runtime, minimum. Given Monarch’s primary purpose and the total lack of useful results, I believe that’s a luxury we cannot afford.¤\n¤\nI recommend shutting them down immediately, or at the latest, during our next reorg. We can reallocate their resources to something useful, and put Ron and Terri’s expertise into great use designing the Lifeboat. I’m sure we wouldn’t regret putting them to work on that, given their track record of working with chronon tech.¤\n¤\nSofia Amaral¤\nHead of Research

Os_jun2_010_BODY=Erica,¤\n¤\nFirst of all, my condolences and apologies. I didn’t realize you had a history with Henry, and frankly, I would not have promoted you into this position had I known. If you would be more comfortable working on something else, I can make that happen, no questions asked. (To be clear, I’m not talking about a demotion, I mean a comparable senior position in another department.)¤\n¤\nYou’re correct in that it’s a very sensitive topic, but given your current security clearance, I can tell you what I know. Unfortunately, I don’t know much. For the past six months, I myself have been trying to work out what happened, but I haven’t made much progress. I know Henry was working late in his lab, and there was some kind of a chronon particle surge. Of course, we know that exposure to large quantities of chronon particles can result in physical changes. Paul Serene is an example of that – his first exposure resulted in his extraordinary abilities, and the second exposure caused his progressive condition. In Henry’s case, that exposure transformed him into a Chronon Disrupted Wave Function Subject, or a Shifter. It is of course clear that Mr. Serene’s and Henry’s conditions are essentially the same thing, even if Mr. Serene’s case hasn’t progressed as far.¤\n¤\nHowever, it’s not at all clear how Henry could have been exposed to such a powerful dose of chronon particles, particularly as the lab area itself underwent none of the temporal changes we have come to associate with such an exceptional event. None of the containers on scene had remotely enough chronon particle capacity for such a high dose, and furthermore, all of them were intact and accounted for. In short, we don’t know where these particles could possibly have come from.¤\n¤\nI’m not surprised that Martin Hatch was unwilling to discuss this. He was the only other person present in the lab when the accident took place, but I don’t know why he was there or what happened, and he claims to have no memory of the events. Despite this, Martin somehow managed to contain Henry in the artificial zero state field set up in the lab.¤\n¤\nI am unwilling to speculate as to how this could possibly have happened. Suffice to say that I have many questions about these events myself.¤\n¤\nThink about my offer, Erica. You’re a first-rate scientist and I would hate to lose you, but I would absolutely understand if you wanted to change departments.¤\n¤\nPlease give my best to your wife; it was lovely to meet her the other week.¤\n¤\nSofia¤\n¤\n---------------------------------------------------------¤\n¤\nTO: SOFIA AMARAL¤\nFROM: ERICA CROSS¤\nDATE: OCT 6, 2016 – 9:18pm¤\nSUBJECT: What happened to Dr. Henry Kim¤\n¤\nSofia,¤\n¤\nI realize this may not be a welcome question, but I feel like I need to ask. I knew Henry Kim very well; I went to school with him, and he was actually my husband’s best man for my first marriage. Unfortunately, when I moved down to Florida, we didn’t manage to stay in touch. Let’s just say that life took me into unexpected directions. It was a very welcome surprise to hear from him when he was recruiting new people, and I’m glad to say we hit it off again. We spoke on the phone a lot, he came over to meet my wife, and, well, it was like old times. (It could’ve been awkward, but it wasn’t. Henry was like that.)¤\n¤\nYou can imagine my shock and disappointment when I heard about his death just a week before my own employment at Monarch began – we didn’t get to work together the way I’d hoped. Now, Monarch has been very good to me, but his death has been eating at me. I know it’s something people don’t want to discuss, and I understand that there are confidentiality issues. However, having recently been cleared for some of the more sensitive chronon research, I now know that the story of his death is a fabrication, and Henry has become something entirely different. I’m not blaming anybody, but for my own peace of mind or sense of closure, I suppose, I’m wondering if, given my new security clearance, you are in a position to explain how this came to pass. ¤\n¤\nI should add that I brought this up with Martin Hatch the other day, and he made it clear in no uncertain terms that I should drop the matter. Given that, I’m taking something of a chance talking to you about this, but I feel like I can’t let this go. I’ll understand if you aren’t allowed to discuss it, but I’m more than a little scared and upset. I hope I can rely on your discretion either way.¤\n¤\nErica

Os_jun4_020_BODY=Mr. Serene,¤\n¤\nI just heard that you ordered Mr. Hatch arrested. I understand that there appears to be damning evidence against him, but at the risk of offering my opinion where it’s not wanted, I ask you to reconsider the situation.¤\n¤\nAs Mr. Hatch has repeatedly said, there are people working against you within Monarch, and I believe he’s right. I don’t know who they are, obviously, but I believe that Mr. Hatch's attempts to expose them have made him a target. I’m sure you can see what I mean: it seems very convenient that just as Mr. Hatch has been trying to convince you that there are people you can’t trust within Monarch, your treatments are destroyed, and he is implicated. Looking at this from the POV of an actual traitor, I can’t think of a better way to get rid of a threat, strike against you AND allay suspicion, all in one bold move.¤\n¤\nObviously, sir, I trust your judgment, and you know I have the highest respect for you. I don’t mean to second-guess you. Still, I’m afraid that you are being manipulated. Martin Hatch is not your enemy.
Os_jun4_020_SUBJECT=Mr. Hatch’s arrest
Os_jun4_030_BODY=Sir,¤\n¤\nThe activation of the Lifeboat strikes me as a prudent measure, and I’m glad we’re not taking any chances on that front. However, having discussed the matter with Mr. Hatch, I’m increasingly worried about Dr. Amaral’s motives. We know that she was involved in the explosion at the treatment lab.¤\n¤\nThe thing is, she’s intelligent and resourceful, but that explosion wasn’t something a clever scientist whipped up all by her lonesome. The lab was blown up with military grade explosives sourced from our armory – an armory she doesn’t have access to – and they weren’t just thrown in at random. Somebody with a solid understanding of structural weaknesses and demolition expertise set them up. That’s military training. So we know she had competent help. That means she’s not working alone. Clearly, Dr. Amaral is connected to Joyce, or she wouldn’t have been “kidnapped” – that had to be her exit strategy; she had to know that we’d trace the lab explosion to her – but that’s not our only concern. We have to try to figure out who she was working with on our end.¤\n¤\nI know her betrayal hurt you personally in more ways than one, and this may not be the easiest time to start looking into this. I hope you know that I’m at your disposal, whatever you need done. I want to get to the bottom of this.
